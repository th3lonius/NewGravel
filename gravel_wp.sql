(For example: <a href="//make.wordpress.org/core/2014/04/15/html5-galleries-captions-in-wordpress-3-9/">HTML5</a>, <a href="//make.wordpress.org/core/2014/04/14/symlinked-plugins-in-wordpress-3-9/">symlinks</a>, <a href="//make.wordpress.org/core/2014/04/07/mysql-in-wordpress-3-9/">MySQL</a>, <a href="//make.wordpress.org/core/2014/04/11/plupload-2-x-in-wordpress-3-9/">Plupload</a>.)</p>\n<p>To test WordPress 3.9 RC2, try the <a href="//wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”).

We&#8217;re sorry we let you down.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve all lost words we&#8217;ve written before, like an email thanks to a cat on the keyboard or a term paper to a blue screen of death. Over the last few WordPress releases, we&#8217;ve made a number of improvements to features like autosaves and revisions. With revisions, an old edit can always be restored. We&#8217;re trying our hardest to save your content somewhere even if your power goes out or your browser crashes. We even monitor your internet connection and prevent you from hitting that &#8220;Publish&#8221; button at the exact moment the coffee shop Wi-Fi has a hiccup.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s <em>possible</em> that the quick draft you lost last week is still in the database, and just hidden from view. As an added complication, these &#8220;discarded drafts&#8221; normally get deleted after seven days, and it&#8217;s already been six days since the release. If we were able to rescue your draft, you&#8217;ll see it on the &#8220;All Posts&#8221; screen after you update to 3.8.3. (We&#8217;ll also be pushing 3.8.3 out as a background update, so you may just see a draft appear.)</p>\n<p>So, if you tried to jot down a quick idea last week, I hope WordPress has recovered it for you.

title="http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2008-February/017888.html" href="http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2008-February/017888.html">particular debate that has been going on for years</a> on whether WordPress is a CMS or not. CMSCritic has a great article by Kaya Ismail, that explains why <a title="http://www.cmscritic.com/wordpress-is-a-cms-whether-you-like-it-or-not/" href="http://www.cmscritic.com/wordpress-is-a-cms-whether-you-like-it-or-not/">WordPress is a CMS (Whether You Like it or Not)</a>. It&#8217;s one of the most refreshing perspectives I&#8217;ve read on the subject. The definition of a Content Management System is <em>a web application designed to make it easy for non-technical users to add, edit and manage a website</em>. WordPress fits that definition rather well and in many respects, excels at it. The problem as Ismail explains, is that the acronym has become muddied over the years.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The issue arises when the stripped down, true meaning of &#8220;CMS&#8221; is blown up with unnecessary jargon. In reality, those definitions hold very little weight, other than when they describe added marketing or administrative extras. The fact of the matter is, WordPress fits the definition of a CMS perfectly.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WordPress has grown up to be far more than just a blogging tool. It&#8217;s used to power apps, run large content heavy websites, and e-commerce. The reputation that it&#8217;s just a blogging tool and not a CMS is false.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re curious on how to use WordPress as a CMS, <a title="http://planetozh.com/blog/2009/09/the-definitive-guide-to-using-wordpress-as-a-cms/" href="http://planetozh.com/blog/2009/09/the-definitive-guide-to-using-wordpress-as-a-cms/">read this guide</a> published by Ozh Richards that contains a simple four step process. It&#8217;s a process nearly all WordPress users go through everyday.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It isn&#8217;t particularly amazing in any niche other than blogging, and it sacrifices being a powerhouse when it comes to things like <a href="http://www.cmscritic.com/dir/dam/">digital asset management</a> for the sake of simplicity. Yet at the same time, WordPress <strong> is </strong> a content management system, and a good one at that.</p>\n<p><strong>So, maybe it&#8217;s time everybody got over it</strong>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ismail sums it up rather well. I think it&#8217;s time to kick this debate to the curb.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 15 Aug 2014 20:38:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:79:"WPTavern: Under the Hood of Semplice: A New Portfolio System Based on WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=27810";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:200:"http://wptavern.com/under-the-hood-of-semplice-a-new-portfolio-system-based-on-wordpress?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=under-the-hood-of-semplice-a-new-portfolio-system-based-on-wordpress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7120:"<p><a href="http://www.semplicelabs.com/" target="_blank">Semplice</a> has soft-launched its new WordPress-powered portfolio system.

On the contrary, the Semplice crew has taken a different route to create this unique editing experience.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For the basic theme options we use <a href="http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/" target="_blank">Advanced Custom Fields</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/elliotcondon" target="_blank">Elliot Condon</a>,&#8221; Van Schneider said. &#8220;The Content Editor itself is a combination of a Javascript frontend that uses the WordPress Ajax functions to communicate with the PHP backend.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As we worked on different Semplice iterations we quickly learned that we need something more than just Custom Post Types, especially since the performance suffered a lot in the beginning,&#8221; he explained. The Semplice content editor is optional and can be activated when creating new pages in WordPress. It includes a live preview as you edit on the frontend, as you can see in the video example below.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>&#8220;What you build is exactly what you get,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This allows you to create very flexible editorial layouts for designers or artists who want to present their work in the best light possible.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Semplice also allows users the ability to brand every page with a unique visual look. Instead of having pages follow a set template, elements such as background color, navigation, and typography can be customized for each.</p>\n<p>The regular WordPress admin is still in play, for example, when a user adds new work. It starts off in the backend with branding and image options.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/add-new-work.png" rel="prettyphoto[27810]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/add-new-work.png?resize=1025%2C740" alt="add-new-work" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28517" /></a></p>\n<p>One unique feature of Semplice is the ability to easily add a new custom fontset to WordPress using the web service of your choice. This is especially important for designers who require unique fonts for presenting their work.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/custom-fontset.png" rel="prettyphoto[27810]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/custom-fontset.png?resize=1025%2C739" alt="custom-fontset" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28520" /></a></p>\n<p>Semplice is geared toward both experienced WordPress users, as well as those who are totally new to the platform. &#8220;Yes, we do aim for people who are familiar with WordPress since they will be able to take Semplice even further than what we offer,&#8221; Van Schneider said. &#8220;But with our Semplice Content Editor we even aim at people who don’t have that much experience with WordPress itself since you don’t really need it.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Licensing, Pricing, and Support</h3>\n<p>Introductory <a href="http://www.semplicelabs.com/get-semplice" target="_blank">Semplice pricing</a> for a single domain is $69 and $299 for an agency. Semplice will be launching without offering customer support and is unusual in that it doesn&#8217;t offer any refunds. Support is limited to the first seven days after purchase. The team will assist with anything related to the default Semplice features and is currently working on establishing a pool of <a href="https://vimeo.com/semplicelabs" target="_blank">video tutorials</a> for documentation.</p>\n<p>While the Semplice team cannot yet offer full product support, they are committed to delivering critical free updates to existing customers. The software is licensed under the GPL. Although Semplice hasn&#8217;t launched yet, early adopters can purchase the software now for a reduced price.</p>\n<p>While the Semplice content editor appeals to new WordPress users, they will still need to overcome the hurdle of installing and setting up a WordPress site on their own domains. Even with 1-click installers, the process can be more difficult than you might imagine for designers and artists with no WordPress experience. Without a fully hosted Semplice platform, the software is going to have to appeal to seasoned WordPress users who appreciate its unique take on building a fullscreen branded portfolio. Do you think Semplice can win out over other theme and plugin-based options?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 15 Aug 2014 20:05:51 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:64:"WPTavern: A Survival Guide To WordCamps For First Time Attendees";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=28486";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:172:"http://wptavern.com/a-survival-guide-to-wordcamps-for-first-time-attendees?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=a-survival-guide-to-wordcamps-for-first-time-attendees";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2348:"<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SurvivalGuideFeaturedImage.png" rel="prettyphoto[28486]"><img class="size-full wp-image-28489" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SurvivalGuideFeaturedImage.png?resize=639%2C207" alt="Survival Guide Featured Image" /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ari/4166542615/">Steve Rhodes</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/">cc</a>\n<p><a title="http://central.wordcamp.org/" href="http://central.wordcamp.org/">WordCamps</a> are excellent opportunities to learn WordPress and have of face-to-face interaction with a lot of different people. They can also be exhausting and possibly stressful for first timers. Carrie Dils has an awesome <a title="http://www.carriedils.com/wordcamp-tips/" href="http://www.carriedils.com/wordcamp-tips/">WordCamp Survival Guide</a> filled with tips and information on how to get the most out of these events.</p>\n<p>Tip number five (don&#8217;t sit by yourself at lunch) routinely happens to me at WordCamps.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When the last morning session breaks, there will be a mad dash to the lunch line (did someone say “food?!”). You’ll grab a sack lunch lovingly provided by some volunteer and then you’ll stand there, possibly awkward and not sure where to go. It’s lunch on the first day at a new school all over again.</p>\n<p>Try this: Head over to any table with open spots and simply ask to sit down. Unless you just really need that lunch break for personal time, don’t miss an opportunity to meet folks over lunch!</p></blockquote>\n<p>I struggle with introducing myself to people I&#8217;ve never met before. At WordCamps, I&#8217;m generally extroverted but I&#8217;ve noticed at larger camps, I become introverted. It&#8217;s a personality thing I&#8217;ve been fighting with for the past few years with mild success. I keep telling myself that I&#8217;m going to introduce myself to everyone I see at a WordCamp but it never works out that way. I end up finding a group of people I&#8217;m familiar with and stick with them. Does anyone else struggle with introversion at WordCamps?</p>\n<p>The survival guide is filled with great information but I think the most important point is the last and that&#8217;s to <strong>have fun</strong>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 15 Aug 2014 19:00:40 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:92:"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 158 – Interview With Pippin Willamson Of Easy Digital Downloads";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:44:"http://wptavern.com?p=28482&preview_id=28482";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:220:"http://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-158-interview-with-pippin-willamson-of-easy-digital-downloads?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wpweekly-episode-158-interview-with-pippin-willamson-of-easy-digital-downloads";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3212:"<p><a title="https://pippinsplugins.com/" href="https://pippinsplugins.com/">Pippin Williamson</a> of <a title="https://easydigitaldownloads.com/" href="https://easydigitaldownloads.com/">Easy Digital Downloads</a> joined <a title="http://marcuscouch.com/" href="http://marcuscouch.com/">Marcus Couch</a> and I to discuss a variety of topics.

Simply set up an RSS -> Twitter action, like <a href="https://zapier.com/zapbook/rss/twitter/35895/rss-new-item-in-feed-to-twitter-create-tweet/" target="_blank">this one</a> with Zapier:</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rss-tweet.png" rel="prettyphoto[28459]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rss-tweet.png?resize=1025%2C207" alt="rss-tweet" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28465" /></a></p>\n<p>Users of <a href="https://ifttt.com/" target="_blank">IFTTT</a> can do the same by creating an RSS to Twitter recipe. You&#8217;ll want to use the <strong>development log feed</strong> on the developers tab of the plugin page. Connecting RSS to Twitter via a service will automate the little tasks involved in promoting your plugin and keeping users up-to-date.</p>\n<h4>Get Notified When a Plugin is Updated</h4>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rss-to-email.png" rel="prettyphoto[28459]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rss-to-email.png?resize=1025%2C426" alt="rss-to-email" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28474" /></a></p>\n<p>Plugin users can also harness the same feed URL to send themselves updates via email. Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;ve got a few specific plugins that you are watching intently for an update. Perhaps you&#8217;ve notified the plugin author of a bug and are waiting for a fix or a new feature that&#8217;s in development. Instead of checking your site or the plugin&#8217;s page on WordPress.org for updates, you can set up an RSS to Email automated task to pull from the plugin&#8217;s development log feed and shoot a notice to your inbox.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 15 Aug 2014 05:14:36 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:30:"Dev Blog: WordPress 4.0 Beta 4";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:33:"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=3280";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:55:"http://wordpress.org/news/2014/08/wordpress-4-0-beta-4/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1990:"<p>The fourth and likely final beta for WordPress 4.0 is now available.

The theme was created by Woo Themes designer <a href="http://jameskoster.co.uk/" target="_blank">James Koster</a> as a child theme for his responsive <a href="http://wordpress.org/themes/highwind" target="_blank">Highwind</a> parent theme.</p>\n<p>Clear Tranquil lives up to its name, inspiring a light, peaceful reading experience that is clutter-free. The design puts your content in focus.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/clear-tranquil.png" rel="prettyphoto[28368]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/clear-tranquil.png?resize=600%2C450" alt="clear-tranquil" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28372" /></a></p>\n<p>Koster gives meticulous attention to typography and highlights the first character of each post with elegant block letter styles. The theme includes a sticky, understated top navigation menu (optional), and zero widget areas. That&#8217;s right, Clear Tranquil is a completely widget-free zone.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/single-post.png" rel="prettyphoto[28368]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/single-post.png?resize=1025%2C737" alt="single-post" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28451" /></a></p>\n<p>The theme includes a handful of customization options built into WordPress&#8217; native customizer. You can personalize it with a custom header, background, and your own color selections for text, links, and backgrounds.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/clear-tranquil-customizer.png" rel="prettyphoto[28368]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/clear-tranquil-customizer.png?resize=1025%2C767" alt="clear-tranquil-customizer" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28371" /></a></p>\n<p>Clear Tranquil includes no additional features, because everything has been intentionally stripped back to keep things simple. Koster hasn&#8217;t set up a live demo of the theme. Ordinarily, the WordPress.org demo gives an unrealistic representation of what a theme will look like. However, in this case, it&#8217;s fairly accurate.</p>\n<p>One of the things that I love about the WordPress theme installation process is that it will automatically install the parent theme for a child theme, if you don&#8217;t already have it installed. In this scenario, if you install Clear Tranquil without Highwind already in place, it will be automatically downloaded for you.</p>\n<p>If your blog has gotten bloated with widgets and is in need of a minimalist makeover, Clear Tranquil might be just the ticket. <a href="http://wordpress.org/themes/clear-tranquil" target="_blank">Download</a> it for free from the WordPress Themes Directory.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 14 Aug 2014 23:04:24 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:71:"WPTavern: Foster Me: A WordPress Plugin to Help Shelter Animals in Need";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=28267";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:184:"http://wptavern.com/foster-me-a-wordpress-plugin-to-help-shelter-animals-in-need?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=foster-me-a-wordpress-plugin-to-help-shelter-animals-in-need";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5833:"<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/dog.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[28267]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/dog.jpg?resize=800%2C397" alt="photo credit: puck90 - cc" class="size-full wp-image-28424" /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/puck90/426370372/">puck90</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/">cc</a>\n<p>Everybody knows that animals need homes.

That&#8217;s where foster homes can help to provide quality care for animals in the interim, until they find their forever homes.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/foster-me-seek-shelter-an-animal-in-need/" target="_blank">Foster Me</a> is a new WordPress plugin designed to help rescues and shelters make available pets more visible and easier to search. It was created by <a href="http://digitalmediagirl.com/" target="_blank">Stephanie Chow</a>, a front-end developer and animal advocate located in Asheville, NC. Her <a href="http://www.lendingapaw.org/" target="_blank">Lending a Paw</a> site features open source plugins and graphics for animal rescue organizations.</p>\n<p>Foster Me makes it easy to list and manage animals in WordPress where they can be searched with advanced pet-specific filters, such as age, type, gender, temperament, special needs, etc.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/foster-me.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[28267]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/foster-me.jpg?resize=1025%2C792" alt="foster-me" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28392" /></a></p>\n<p>When a visitor clicks on an available pet, the listing launches in a modal window. Individual pet listings display a full description, a slider with multiple photographs, and any applicable pet categories.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/pet-listing.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[28267]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/pet-listing.jpg?resize=1025%2C522" alt="pet-listing" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28407" /></a></p>\n<p>The plugin also makes it easy to list fostering information and to post your foster application. Chow has made every effort to make Foster Me a user-friendly plugin for rescues and shelters that may not have a WordPress expert on staff. The settings page allows you to easily customize the color and appearance of the header, pet options, pet grid and modal window.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/foster-me-settings.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[28267]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/foster-me-settings.jpg?resize=658%2C764" alt="foster-me-settings" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28411" /></a></p>\n<p>Foster Me also includes an image widget for showcasing foster pets as well as a Recently Added widget to display new additions.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/foster-me-widget.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[28267]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/foster-me-widget.jpg?resize=756%2C722" alt="foster-me-widget" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28412" /></a></p>\n<p>The plugin adds a whole suite of pet listing features that are general enough to be used in any kind of shelter or rescue website:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Filterable</strong> &#8211; filter by Type, Age, Size, Gender, Temperament, and Special Needs</li>\n<li><strong>Searchable</strong> &#8211; list is narrowed with every letter you type into search bar</li>\n<li><strong>Click On Any Pet</strong> &#8211; to view more information and photos</li>\n<li><strong>List Your Fostering Info</strong> &#8211; show how it works what to expect when you foster</li>\n<li><strong>Colors</strong> &#8211; are completely customizable to match your brand</li>\n<li><strong>Image Widget</strong> &#8211; place in sidebar to display a linkable, rotating image of foster pets</li>\n<li><strong>Recently Added Widget</strong> &#8211; place in sidebar to display your most recently added fosters</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Check out a <a href="http://www.lendingapaw.org/foster-me-demo/" target="_blank">live demo</a> of Foster Me to test out the pet searching and filtering capabilities.</p>\n<p>Chow&#8217;s first plugin, <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/petfinder-search-rescue/" target="_blank">Petfinder: Search and Rescue</a>, is very similar to her latest release, except it requires the animals to be listed on Petfinder. If you already have your shelter or rescue pets listed on Petfinder, then this alternative will be a better option for automatically pulling in your existing listings.</p>\n<h3>Saving Animals with WordPress</h3>\n<p>The <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/foster-me-seek-shelter-an-animal-in-need/" target="_blank">Foster Me</a> plugin is an awesome open source tool that any shelter or rescue can use for free in combination with an existing WordPress site. When it comes to helping animals find their forever homes, open source software may not be the first thing that comes to mind, but Stephanie Chow is knocking it out of the park with her user-friendly tools designed to serve people who are rescuing creatures in need. Open source tools are more accessible to shelters and rescues that are spending every last dime to help animals find homes. If you have WordPress skills and are able to hook up a shelter with a website, then the <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/foster-me-seek-shelter-an-animal-in-need/" target="_blank">Foster Me</a> plugin will put you well on your way.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 14 Aug 2014

and Brad Williams Join Forces\n<p>In the time Dre Armeda spent with <a title="https://sucuri.net/" href="https://sucuri.net/">Sucuri</a>, he turned a two-person part-time hobby into a multi-million dollar, 30+ employee company. When Armeda <a title="http://dremeda.com/fair-winds-and-following-seas-sucuri/" href="http://dremeda.com/fair-winds-and-following-seas-sucuri/">left the company</a> he helped found, he didn&#8217;t provide any hints as to where he was going.</p>\n<p>Three months after leaving Sucuri, Armeda <a title="http://webdevstudios.com/2014/08/14/dre-armeda-joins-webdevstudios/" href="http://webdevstudios.com/2014/08/14/dre-armeda-joins-webdevstudios/">has been named</a> the Vice President of Operations for <a title="http://webdevstudios.com/" href="http://webdevstudios.com/">WebDevStudios</a>. Brad Williams, co-owner of WebDevStudios and Armeda were kind enough to answer a few questions I had regarding the hire.</p>\n<h2>Interview With Dre Armeda and Brad Williams</h2>\n<p><strong>What does the Vice President of Operations for WebDevStudios do?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Brad Williams</em> &#8211; The Vice President of Operations is a new role at WDS and our first Executive position outside of the original Partners.  WDS has been growing quite a bit this year and we knew it was time to start expanding the leadership team. Dre brings a wealth of knowledge and a ton of experience to WDS, specifically around building a very successful distributed company.  Some of the primary responsibilities for Dre include business development, improving operational efficiency, marketing, and even sales.  Roles at WDS are always evolving, so I certainly expect Dre&#8217;s position to really evolve and be defined over the next few months.</p>\n<p><strong>In some instances, businesses can ruin friendships. How did you two factor that into the equation before making the hire? Will the fact that you&#8217;re now co-workers have an effect on your personal relationship?</strong></p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/DreandBrad.png" rel="prettyphoto[28328]"><img class="size-full wp-image-28378" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/DreandBrad.png?resize=698%2C353" alt="Dre and Brad at WCSF 2013" /></a>Image Courtesy Of <a title="http://designsimply.com/2013/08/25/photos-from-wcsf-2013/mcm_8499/" href="http://designsimply.com/2013/08/25/photos-from-wcsf-2013/mcm_8499/">Designsimply.com</a>\n<p><em>Brad Williams</em> &#8211; When we started discussing the possibility of Dre Armeda joining WDS, this was the first item we discussed. We knew from the start that we had to look at this from a business perspective and not because we are close friends. The last thing either of us would ever want would be to ruin the friendship that we have. Dre Armeda is a perfect fit for WDS, not only in the business sense, but also our company culture. We work hard, and play hard, and no one works and plays harder than Dre Armeda!</p>\n<p><strong>Out of all the possible places to work in the WordPress ecosystem, why did you choose WebDevStudios?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Dre Armeda</em> &#8211; There is certainly a long relationship there with the leadership, the company, and the team. Brad Williams and I of course are the co-hosts of <a title="http://dradcast.com/" href="http://dradcast.com/">DradCast</a> and have even presented on the topic of security together in years past at WordCamps. While part of Sucuri, we successfully worked with WebDevstudios in various capacities. The direction of the company, and the culture is very much inline with where I want to be, and where I want to go. Along with that connection, our long relationship, and the experience I can bring to the table, I think the decision was easy.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you look at this as a long-term (2-3 year) position?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Dre Armeda</em> &#8211; One of the key points we talked about as we started looking into the possibility of working together was exactly that. We were looking for a long term situation and we’re excited about what the future brings!</p>\n<p><strong>What lessons or experiences did you learn with Sucuri that you&#8217;ll be able to apply to improve WebDevStudios?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Dre Armeda</em> &#8211; The position will encompass a broad range of responsibilities and oversight ranging from organizational and business development, to talent development and strategy. I&#8217;ve had the great opportunity to work in these areas over the past five years as I helped build Sucuri into the successful organization it is today.</p>\n<p>I am very passionate about better serving our audience by expanding global reach and I’m certainly excited about increasing overall organizational efficiency through resourcing, process improvement, and business development.

George Stephanis, a member of the Jetpack development team, has <a title="http://wptavern.com/easier-way-to-enable-or-disable-jetpack-modules-with-rocketeer#comment-49494" href="http://wptavern.com/easier-way-to-enable-or-disable-jetpack-modules-with-rocketeer#comment-49494">consistently explained</a> that &#8220;Jetpack only auto-activates modules that provide enhancements without affecting the front-end layout of the site.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Earlier today, Stephanis <a title="http://stephanis.info/2014/08/13/on-jetpack-and-auto-activating-modules/" href="http://stephanis.info/2014/08/13/on-jetpack-and-auto-activating-modules/">published a post on his blog</a> that goes into detail on how the decision is made to auto-activate a module.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We’ve spoken to many, many users who find a default feature set convenient, and resent having to make a bunch of ‘decision points’ if they had to manually activate each and every module. Good software should run well <a href="http://wordpress.org/about/philosophy/#box">out of the box</a>. So we’ve set up the defaults as we have. Yes, <a href="http://wordpress.org/about/philosophy/#minority">some people disagree and are vocal about not wanting anything to auto-activate</a>. That’s okay. We try to <a href="http://wordpress.org/about/philosophy/#majority">design for the majority</a>, with the best user experience we can provide.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I appreciate the fact that new modules <strong>will not</strong> auto-activate if they impact the front end of my site. In this instance, the decisions being made for me are a convenience, not a hassle. If you disagree with the decisions being made, there are <a title="http://jeremy.hu/customize-the-list-of-modules-available-in-jetpack/" href="http://jeremy.hu/customize-the-list-of-modules-available-in-jetpack/">several filters</a> you can use to customize the Jetpack experience, including one to deactivate all modules by default.</p>\n<p><code>add_filter( ''jetpack_get_default_modules'', ''__return_empty_array'' );</code></p>\n<p>I doubt his post will resonate with those who have a strong stance against auto-activating anything.

Today, the app&#8217;s developer, Stuart Starr, announced what is perhaps the most convenient feature to date.</p>\n<p>With <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wpcore/" target="_blank">WPCore Plugin Manager</a> installed, users can now export all of their plugins with one click and save them to a new collection on WPcore.com. This is useful if you have a site that already has all the plugins you want to include in a specific collection.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/export.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[28318]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/export.jpg?resize=513%2C211" alt="export" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28336" /></a></p>\n<p>Despite the fact that the plugin makes it convenient to install all your favorite plugins in one click, you may find that building collections requires quite a bit of work. The new export feature makes it possible to build a collection instantly, based on an existing site&#8217;s active plugins. Currently, it can only export active plugins hosted on WordPress.org, but Starr plans to expand the feature in the future.</p>\n<h3>Clone WordPress Plugin Collections</h3>\n<p>Another new feature that you&#8217;ll find on the app side of WPCore is the ability to clone other users&#8217; collections. Perhaps you want most of the plugins in one collection but want to add or remove a few selections. Click on the new clone button to copy the collection to your own account for editing.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/clone-collection.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[28318]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/clone-collection.jpg?resize=983%2C518" alt="clone-collection" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28345" /></a></p>\n<p>Starr is continuing development on the app and plugin, inspired by positive feedback from users who are saving time with WPCore. &#8220;The feedback has been amazing. In terms of users we are getting new users daily,&#8221; he said. One satisfied fan dubbed WPCore the &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/kierstenbogush/status/498723752721391617" target="_blank">Pinterest for WordPress plugins</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>September will bring a major update to the service. Starr wouldn&#8217;t comment on the specifics of features on the way but he did reveal that he is currently working on a referral system. <a href="http://wptavern.com/wpcore-plugin-manager-adds-update-notifications-plans-to-implement-pro-subscription" target="_blank">WPCore is moving to a paid subscription model</a> as of August 31st but users who sign up before that time will be grandfathered in as Pro members for life.

Many plugins use language-specific shortcodes to surround embedded code, but this generally requires you to remember the right way to form the shortcode. The new <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-rainbow-hilite/" target="_blank">WordPress Rainbow Hilite</a> plugin uses a different method for embedding code in posts.</p>\n<p>The plugin incorporates the lightweight <a href="http://craig.is/making/rainbows" target="_blank">Rainbow.js</a> syntax highlighting library into WordPress and is completely themable via CSS. Rainbow Hilite utilizes the visual editor to add language-specific styles to pre tags.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rainbow-hilite-editor.png" rel="prettyphoto[28270]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rainbow-hilite-editor.png?resize=653%2C526" alt="rainbow-hilite-editor" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28284" /></a></p>\n<p>The plugin includes support for 18 commonly used languages, which can be enabled or disabled in the settings located in the Writing panel:</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rainbow-languages.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[28270]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rainbow-languages.jpg?resize=977%2C310" alt="rainbow-languages" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28274" /></a></p>\n<p>It also includes 19 preset visual themes to choose from for making your code beautiful. The settings panel allows you to toggle a sample code block in order to conveniently preview each theme without having to navigate to the frontend.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/toggle-code.gif" rel="prettyphoto[28270]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/toggle-code.gif?resize=850%2C504" alt="toggle-code" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28276" /></a></p>\n<p>Below is an example of how code appears on the frontend using the plugin&#8217;s sample code. One handy thing Rainbow Hilite&#8217;s output is that the highlighted code can be copy-pasted directly out of the site. There&#8217;s no &#8220;view raw&#8221; button to clutter up the code snippet.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rainbow-example.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[28270]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rainbow-example.jpg?resize=652%2C568" alt="rainbow-example" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28275" /></a></p>\n<p>Line numbers are optional and when active they are added using <a href="https://github.com/Sjeiti/rainbow.linenumbers" target="_blank">rainbow.linenumbers</a>. The plugin also includes some <a href="https://github.com/mcguffin/wp-rainbow-hilite#plugin-api" target="_blank">filters</a>, which allow users to load their own language modules and themes and plugins to hook in.</p>\n<p>If you ever decide to stop using the plugin, pre tags aren&#8217;t as bad as orphaned shortcodes littered throughout your posts. In other words, using it doesn&#8217;t mean that you&#8217;re married to the plugin for life. If you&#8217;d like to suggest any changes, the development version of Rainbow Hilite is available on <a href="https://github.com/mcguffin/wp-rainbow-hilite" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. If you want to use the plugin on your site,  you can <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-rainbow-hilite/" target="_blank">download</a> it from WordPress.org.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 13 Aug 2014 20:03:49

Just one month away: <strong>Saturday 13 September 2014</strong>.  This is one day that brings together the local WordPress community like no other.  We tend to get a wide range of people attending, from those just starting out, to designers, developers, consultants, and people who contribute to the core code of WordPress.</p>\n<p>WordCamp SLC is a great opportunity to learn a few things from the presentations.  Even more important than that is the chance to get to know other WordPress users in the community.</p>\n<p>One really important thing to note for 2014, the <a href="http://2014.slc.wordcamp.org/location/">location has changed</a>:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>City And County Building<br />\n451 Washington Square,<br />\nSalt Lake City, Utah</p>\n<p>The <a href="http://2014.slc.wordcamp.org/tickets/">registration this year is only $15</a>, which includes lunch.  The reduced price is to help offset the cost of parking in down town SLC.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in speaking there is still time to <a href="http://2014.slc.wordcamp.org/speakers/speaker-application/">submit a presentation proposal</a>.</p>\n<p>Go <a href="http://2014.slc.wordcamp.org/tickets/">register</a> today and be sure to say hi when I see you on September 13th.  Then go give a big thank you to <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeHansenMe">Mike Hansen</a>, he is organizing <a href="http://2014.slc.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp SLC 2014</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 13 Aug 2014 15:49:46 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"Joseph Scott";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:41:"Matt: Extrinsic Motivation Doesn’t Work";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=43987";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:53:"http://ma.tt/2014/08/extrinsic-motivation-doesntwork/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:376:"<p>From <a href="http://seriouspony.com/">Kathy Sierra</a>, here&#8217;s &#8220;One of the longest deep studies on negative impact of external reinforcers (e.g. rewards) on long-term motivation&#8221;: <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/111/30/10990.full">Multiple types of motives don&#8217;t multiply the motivation of West Point cadets</a>.

use on self-hosted sites. This striking minimalist portfolio theme was created with designers, photographers, and artists in mind.</p>\n<p>Espied utilizes WordPress.com&#8217;s <a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/portfolios/" target="_blank">portfolio</a> feature, which was recently <a href="http://wptavern.com/jetpack-rebrands-with-new-logo-adds-custom-post-types-in-3-1-release" target="_blank">added to Jetpack</a>. With this custom content type enabled, users can easily manage and showcase projects with the <code>[portfolio]</code> shortcode.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/espied.png" rel="prettyphoto[28131]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/espied.png?resize=880%2C660" alt="espied" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28133" /></a></p>\n<p>Customization options for Espied include support for a 1600 × 320px header image, the ability to set the header text color, and a unique option for setting the thumbnail aspect ratio. Featured image ratio options include landscape (4:3), portrait (3:4), and square (1:1). This setting carries over to archive pages, the portfolio page template, and portfolio shortcodes.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/espied-archive-page.png" rel="prettyphoto[28131]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/espied-archive-page.png?resize=1025%2C780" alt="espied-archive-page" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28247" /></a></p>\n<p>The theme includes a sidebar that slides out to display navigation and widgets. It is hidden until clicked in order to keep the focus on showcasing your work.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/sidebar.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[28131]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/sidebar.jpg?resize=660%2C336" alt="sidebar" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28250" /></a></p>\n<p>Espied also features a beautiful way to display your social links via a custom menu. Add your social URLs as menu items and the theme will automatically display the right icon, if it&#8217;s available. It currently includes 22 different icons for various social profiles.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/social-links.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[28131]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/social-links.jpg?resize=660%2C305" alt="social-links" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28249" /></a></p>\n<p>Espied showcases images at full width on larger displays so it&#8217;s important to use images that are at least 1272px. Although the theme does include beautiful, readable typography for blogging, the design is probably best-suited for sites that are primarily portfolios or other visual showcases. Check out a <a href="http://espieddemo.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">live demo</a> on WordPress.com to see the theme in action.</p>\n<p>With the release of Espied, the folks at Automattic are approaching 50 free themes listed on WordPress.org.

I’ve tried to make something that makes all the requirements easier to understand.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Theme Checklist is not meant to be a replacement for the <a title="https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/">Theme Check</a> plugin. Instead, it&#8217;s a collection of the most common snag points witnessed by Priday in the theme review queue. According to Priday, the queue has a five-week backlog. He hopes Theme Checklist helps decrease the queue and gets more theme developers to pass the initial review.</p>\n<p>I understand why the theme review guidelines need to be thorough and specific. It&#8217;s the WordPress.org theme directory and they help create a consistent user experience. Plugins like Theme Checklist provide an alternative learning experience to accomplish the same goal. However, it has to remain on par with the official guidelines or else it could end up doing more harm than good.</p>\n<p>Theme developers, is this a tool you see yourself using?

They just won&#8217;t be built using the model that indie developers are used to.</p>\n<p>There will be apps supported by alternative revenue streams. Some might have ads or sponsorships, some might mine and sell the data they produce, some (like Evernote and Dropbox) will be a gateway to a commercial service. People will figure out ways to get money out of a large enough user base, and apps will get built.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve seen this happen in the WordPress ecosystem already. It&#8217;s a different beast because it&#8217;s an Open Source community, but it&#8217;s still an interesting parallel.</p>\n<p>Basically this happened:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A bunch of folks built stuff and released it all for free to a small community, largely consisting of fellow developers and tinkerers</li>\n<li>A whole bunch more folks started using the platform and the community grew &#8211; it wasn&#8217;t just developers anymore, it was end users with expectations of support, etc.</li>\n<li>Devs wanted to start monetizing the products they were providing</li>\n<li>The platform didn&#8217;t provide the tools to make money in the way that the devs wanted -instead it invested in tools to promote free products</li>\n<li>Eventually a variety of patterns arose to monetize both commercial and &#8220;free&#8221; products (subscription clubs with access to a bunch of different plugins/themes, free products with commercial add-ons, sponsorships and ads, products that were created to support hosting services, etc.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It&#8217;s not the  <img src="http://alexking.org/wp-content/themes/alexking.org-v3/smilies/ak_scare1.gif" alt=":scare:" class="wp-smiley" />  pure  <img src="http://alexking.org/wp-content/themes/alexking.org-v3/smilies/ak_scare2.gif" alt=":/scare:" class="wp-smiley" />  and direct approach of charging directly for the software, but it&#8217;s still developers writing code and making money.</p>\n<p>The same thing is happening for iOS. There is money to be made. The platform and consumers are winning.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Adapt or die&#8221; is our mantra for those business who are threatened by technology. We have little sympathy for newspapers, the music industry, etc. Perhaps it&#8217;s time to include software companies in that list.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 12 Aug 2014 21:53:56 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Alex";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:110:"WPTavern: Sprout Apps to Launch a Suite of WordPress-Powered Apps Targeted at Freelancers and Small Businesses";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=28141";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:264:"http://wptavern.com/sprout-apps-to-launch-a-suite-of-wordpress-powered-apps-targeted-at-freelancers-and-small-businesses?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=sprout-apps-to-launch-a-suite-of-wordpress-powered-apps-targeted-at-freelancers-and-small-businesses";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6601:"<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/sprout-apps.png" rel="prettyphoto[28141]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/sprout-apps.png?resize=1025%2C464" alt="sprout-apps" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28152" /></a></p>\n<p><a href="https://sproutapps.co/" target="_blank">Sprout Apps</a> will soon be launching a suite of business apps targeted at WordPress freelancers and small businesses. WordPress developer <a href="http://dancameron.org/" target="_blank">Daniel Cameron</a> is behind the project, which is centered around creating plugins that help business owners work more efficiently with WordPress. Sprout Apps aims to bring tasks like invoicing, estimates, and client tracking into the admin.</p>\n<p>Cameron is the creator of <a href="http://smartecart.com/" target="_blank">Smart eCart</a>, a popular solution for daily deals, crowdfunding and social commerce. For five years he has supported and maintained the plugin, which was originally created for a client project. With the desire to venture out and create something new, Cameron has soft-launched Sprout Apps, starting with <a href="https://sproutapps.co/sprout-invoices/" target="_blank">Sprout Invoices</a>, now available for purchase.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/sprout-apps-invoices.png" rel="prettyphoto[28141]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/sprout-apps-invoices.png?resize=500%2C387" alt="sprout-apps-invoices" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-28154" /></a></p>\n<p>Sprout Invoicing is an idea that Cameron had cooked up year ago but was hesitant about, due to the fact that other plugin developers had explored it without much success.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I went back to my original idea that I had years ago, which was a new invoicing app that solved all the problems I’ve had with Freshbooks and Harvest,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I knew there were already plugins out there which made me reluctant to pursue it further, regardless if their approach was wrong in my opinion.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Sprout Invoicing Aims to Help Streamline and Brand All Client Communications</h3>\n<p>In order to sell his product, Cameron will have to convince business owners of the value in using a WordPress-powered invoicing system instead of the many standalone services. He&#8217;s counting on customers&#8217; desire to <a href="https://sproutapps.co/news/what-sprout-invoices-solves-for-freelancers-and-wordpress-sites/" target="_blank">streamline all aspects of their businesses</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Those other standalone services are silo’d, expensive, limiting and offer limited customization for brand integrity,&#8221; Cameron contends. &#8220;I want to streamline the estimate and invoicing process. Integrating it within the site that already has the estimate request (contact form) helps tremendously.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In addition to fully automating estimating and invoicing, the app is designed to help business owners overcome the branding limitations of popular invoicing services, which generally only let you upload a logo to a subdomain. The freedom to fully brand all client communications is a big win for small businesses.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Sprout Invoice notification emails are sent from your server and your from address,&#8221; Cameron said. &#8220;No more http://yoursite.harvestbooks.com with a &#8216;Powered by A Service I Pay For&#8217;.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The invoicing app is built with business owner&#8217;s needs in mind. It&#8217;s packed full of dashboards and charts, summaries, and dynamic reporting that can be easily sorted and filtered in the WordPress admin.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/sprout-invoicing-charts.gif" rel="prettyphoto[28141]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/sprout-invoicing-charts.gif?resize=606%2C342" alt="sprout-invoicing-charts" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28159" /></a></p>\n<p>Under the hood, Sprout Invoices is a WordPress plugin that uses custom post types, post meta and taxonomies for its data structure. &#8220;There are no additional tables created. The entire code base adheres to WordPress coding practices,&#8221; Cameron told the Tavern. &#8220;There&#8217;s hundreds of hooks and filters in SI, I want the entire app to be customizable and I anticipate it’s users to want more control than traditional WP users.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The apps he <a href="https://sproutapps.co/coming-soon/" target="_blank">plans to build</a> are actually WordPress plugins, though he felt that apps was a more applicable term. &#8220;I didn’t want to go with &#8216;Sprout plugins,&#8217; for example, because I do have ideas that aren&#8217;t plugins and I didn&#8217;t want to box myself in,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I also think &#8216;Apps&#8217; is a better term for these larger premium plugins since they offer more than a traditional plugin that might filter post content.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Sprout&#8217;s next app will be a CRM, followed by a team-based app. Cameron is also considering a PM app and a time tracker, depending on how sales go with the invoicing app. <a href="https://sproutapps.co/sprout-invoices/purchase/" target="_blank">Pricing</a> for Sprouts Invoicing is similar to that of popular invoicing services, with both monthly and yearly subscription rates at $5 and $9 respectively. Subscribers will receive updates, support and <a href="https://sproutapps.co/marketplace/" target="_blank">add-on</a> discounts. Cameron also plans to launch a free version of the invoicing app later this year.</p>\n<p>Sprout Apps is built on the bold premise that your WordPress site can be more than just the marketing face of your business. It can also power the daily tasks of estimating work, billing clients, and charting progress. Cameron is aiming to provide all the business essentials with the added benefit of brand independence, a streamlined workflow, and total control. He&#8217;s got a big vision to create a superior suite of apps that will support the many freelancers and small businesses that make up a large segment of the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n<p><a href="https://sproutapps.co/" target="_blank">Sprout Apps</a> is currently in pre-launch mode and will officially launch at <a href="http://2014.la.wordcamp.org/" target="_blank">WordCamp LA</a> in early September. A <a href="https://sproutapps.co/demos/" target="_blank">live demo</a> of the app is available to preview and pre-launch subscribers will receive a discount at purchase.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 12 Aug 2014 20:54:38 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:40:"WPTavern: WP Site Care Acquires Audit WP";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=28140";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:124:"http://wptavern.com/wp-site-care-acquires-audit-wp?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wp-site-care-acquires-audit-wp";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1996:"<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/MergeFeaturedImage.png" rel="prettyphoto[28140]"><img class="size-full wp-image-28143" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/MergeFeaturedImage.png?resize=678%2C252" alt="Merge Featured Image" /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/rutlo/3743291132/">rutlo</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">cc</a>\n<p><a title="http://auditwp.com/" href="http://auditwp.com/">Audit WP</a> has been acquired by <a title="http://www.wpsitecare.com" href="http://www.wpsitecare.com">WP Site Care</a>.

Started by <a href="https://twitter.com/rob_neu">Rob Neu</a> and <a href="http://jacobking.com">Jacob King</a>, the site launched in February, and <a href="http://www.wpsitecare.com/rob-neu-auditwp-join-wp-site-care/">today it&#8217;s been acquired by WP Site Care</a>.</p>\n<p>They made an early splash after their launch when Jacob <a href="http://auditwp.com/wp-engine-seo-failboat/">wrote a provocative post</a> about WP Engine&#8217;s SEO policies. Aside from that, they set out to productize technical SEO and general website strategy.</p>\n<p>Their product was fairly successful, but they learned a valuable lesson; they were limiting their consulting opportunities for larger contracts by productizing &#8212; and therefore bracketing themselves at a relatively low price &#8212; their entry level services. That said, the product was quite good, and will now be part of WP Site Care&#8217;s offering in the form of a la carte SEO consulting, reports, and tools.</p>\n<p>I had a call with Rob and Jacob a couple of months ago to demo their product, and because I needed real help from them. I&#8217;d been getting clobbered by Google, and they helped me identify some of the reasons why and set about a plan to fix it. I&#8217;m still working on it, and was very pleased with what they offered.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7079" src="http://www.poststat.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/audit-wp-overview-752x488.jpg" alt="audit-wp-overview" width="627" height="406" /></p>\n<p>This and other tools were quite nice, and the value I got from a short call and report were pretty enormous. I think this will be a compelling product for WP Site Care&#8217;s services, and it will fit in well with their other offerings.</p>\n<p>If you know Rob Neu and WP Site Care&#8217;s owner, Ryan Sullivan, then you already know they are friends. Rob joining WP Site Care doesn&#8217;t come as a shock, and seems to make sense all around. The two are already working on a separate side project together, called <a href="http://flagshipwp.com/">Flagship</a>, a theme company. Additionally, WP Site Care was a sponsor and often attendee on WP Bacon, Rob&#8217;s old podcast that also unfortunately bit the dust.</p>\n<p>Rob and Ryan&#8217;s partnership for Flagship will remain separate, and Rob will be the Director of Digital Strategy for WP Site Care, now a team of five full time employees. Rob is a technical guy, and in addition to running strategy and marketing for WP Site Care, he&#8217;ll be working on refining some of their product offerings as well.</p>\n<h3>What is WP Site Care anyway?</h3>\n<p>I talked about WP Site Care and other <a title="The rise of WordPress maintenance services" href="http://www.poststat.us/rise-wordpress-maintenance-services/">WordPress maintenance services</a> earlier this year. Essentially it&#8217;s a combination of monthly maintenance and support, and a la carte services.

(98, 1, '2010-04-20 05:29:49', '2010-04-20 05:29:49', '	<p>A documentary-filmmaking crew is dispatched to Culloden Moor to provide coverage on what may be a historically important battle between a Jacobite confederacy of Highland Scots and an English army loyal to the British government&#8230; except that it&#8217;s already taken place. The year is 1746 and we already know the battle has at least some historical import if someone bothered to record it. Anachronism is part of director Watkins&#8217; conceptual tool belt, and he employs it here with no less imagination and ingenuity than later masterpieces. If it sounds like a mockumentary, and technically it is, keep in mind that the upending of genre conventions is only a mere pretense, a vehicle to take us somewhere else entirely. Out of time.</p>\n\n	<p>Another Watkins trademark is usefully employed in <em>Culloden</em>: his utilizing the talents of non-professional actors. We get to know a whole host of characters in uniform, each with distinct features and predilections, each with a reason for fighting no matter how delusional. The Scots by and large are a rabble of men, cobbled together from various clans for various reasons, foremost among them money for their families and glory for their names. Watkins treats us to full-frame close-ups with laconic sketches drawn from the characters&#8217; own lips, giving the audience a sense of personal investment in the battle to come and raising our ire at the whole bloody mess.</p>\n\n	<p>Perhaps the figure that looms largest is Charles Edward Stuart, commander-in-chief of the confederacy of Scots and pretender to the English throne, who is remembered by history and in song as Bonnie Prince Charlie, the dashing, young rebel and reluctant war-maker. Watkins dissipates this inflated image immediately. He presents Charles as a bumbling half-wit utterly convinced of his own rectitude and invulnerability (though in terms of historical inscrutability he was right). He puts his faith in Captain Sir John McDonald as battle-strategist, perhaps the greatest ineptitude of all. Culloden Moor is the wrong place at the wrong time to stage a last-ditch offensive, and everyone behind Scottish lines seems to know it except Charles and his cronies.</p>\n\n	<p>The first half of the film up to and including the waging of the battle is marked stylistically by an incongruity between narration and visual content. The narrator (Watkins himself) gives us a colored account of the men in uniform and their present circumstances&#8212;he mentions that Captain McDonald is &#8220;aged, frequently intoxicated and&#8230; a man of the most limited capacities&#8221;; and Charles Edward&#8217;s only prior military experience was &#8220;ten days attendance at a siege at the age of thirteen&#8221;&#8212;as the camera captures them in heroic poses. In fact, if you muted the volume, the entire first half might appear to be nothing more than a spontaneous document. </p>\n\n	<p>What proceeds is one of the most lopsided battles in recorded history, with the Scots being painted all over the lowland peat by bullet and cannon. Reporting from the sidelines is famous historian Andrew Henderson, who amusingly updates the documentary crew on the shifting tides of the battle and often has to shout to be heard over the din. Even Henderson cannot make what&#8217;s on display more compelling than a man swatting a fly. The English rank and file appear at times to cringe in the direction of the Scots. This is a victory tainted by feelings of pity for the enemy&#8212;a queasy satisfaction. During and after the battle the director continually tests our perspective. Instead of presenting events as they were recorded&#8212;case closed&#8212;he allows the audience to contemplate what could have been. What if the leadership were different? What if Prince Charles had contemplated the protestations of his own men? What if clan loyalties hadn&#8217;t interfered with conduct? What if Culloden Moor hadn&#8217;t been deemed a suitable battleground? </p>\n\n	<p>But of even greater interest perhaps than the battle itself is the ethnic cleansing that followed, and this is where Watkins&#8217; dramatic emphasis is really placed. There is a desire on the English side not to merely punish or demand tribute from the clans, but to extirpate the families who raised and supported the soldiers. What follows is a brutal campaign, one that effectively &#8220;[tears] apart forever the clan system of the Scottish Highlands&#8221;. Watkins again punctuates the brutality with an ironic disparity between temporal and spatial representation, but this time the narrator gives us the widely-dispersed and believed account while the camera shows us otherwise. Meanwhile, Charles, who abandoned his men on the battlefield, has taken shelter among his supporters until the opportunity arises to flee to France. Thus the memory of Charles the war hero survives the merciless aftermath of his blundering. To the victor belong the spoils, which includes the account.</p>\n\n	<p>Watkins uses history to posit his own immaterial dialectics, asking us to think of events in abstract and often complex ways, as the alternating modes of presentation and perspective would suggest: in the film&#8217;s second act, the illusion of vérité is largely kept intact, but the camera favors a more dramatically selective approach&#8212;and the tonal shift amply demonstrates, better than any revisionist historian could, the tragedy not only of the inhuman acts committed, but of the gloss of comforting myth over reality. Those folks who are fed up with the way history is presented by the well-meaning pedagogues, the apologists and the reigning arbiters of realpolitik, would do well to seek out Peter Watkins&#8217; oeuvre. He understands that the presentation of history has less to do with facts than with hypotheses. As this film and others will attest, this is a filmmaker who would rather defy stubborn beliefs than deify them.</p>', 'Culloden', '', 'trash', 'open', 'open', '', 'culloden', '', '', '2014-08-17 17:01:22', '2014-08-17 17:01:22', '', 0, 'http://www.cinelogue.com/reviews/culloden', 0, 'post', '', 0),
(99, 1, '2010-05-11 07:13:33', '2010-05-11 07:13:33', '	<p>The titular year is 1965, the final year of Maoist-styled-dictator Sukarno&#8217;s unimpeded reign over Indonesia. Guy Hoffman (Mel Gibson) is a young Aussie journalist arriving in Jakarta on the eve of the &#8217;30 September Movement&#8217; coup attempt. Guy&#8217;s predecessor is so eager to leave Indonesia that he doesn&#8217;t acquaint Guy with his local contacts, but Guy goes nonetheless, like any good film loner, hoping to &#8220;bluff his way through&#8221;. Billy Kwan (Linda Hunt), a half-Chinese, half-pint photographer, takes a keen interest in the neophyte and hopes to acquaint him with the environs and possibly become his new partner. Billy introduces Guy to the sultry Jillian (Sigourney Weaver), an officer at the British Embassy, who quickly promulgates a fling.</p>\n\n	<p>Peter Weir&#8217;s adaptation of C.J. Koch&#8217;s popular novel is a tempest of politics, rebellion and romantic intrigue, where time and space are tantamount considerations in a work that seeks the universe. Weir again utilizes the photographic talents of Russell Boyd whose work is consistently mesmerizing. Though the film was primarily shot in the Philippines, Boyd&#8217;s camera probes the streets and slums, the river lean-tos and graceful estates with awe as if it were Jakarta. Maurice Jarre&#8217;s score is no less enchanting. These combined talents make for a riveting drama and a romantic exodus by our lovers&#8212;Gibson and Weaver have a natural chemistry in this film, and their rebellious romp through dangerous territories lives up to its promise. But the film is every bit as heart-rending as it is romantic. </p>\n\n	<p>Billy Kwan is the film&#8217;s conscience, an altruist who puts himself at risk to help those who can&#8217;t help themselves, and speaks for them likewise. Initially praising Sukarno&#8217;s government, he comes to loathe it for its circumspect rationing and subsequent neglect of the food shortages causing starvation and upheaval. Billy desperately wants to photograph the turmoil, and he needs Guy to provide him a context. We learn that Guy is in Jakarta primarily because of a sensation piece he did on poverty, a report which Jill found &#8220;melodramatic&#8221;. Billy tells Guy a parable penned by Dostoyevsky as a sort of litmus test, for he hopes Guy shares his feelings on social action and is willing to be his counterpart. But we get to know Guy better than that. He probably exaggerated that star-making article&#8212;not because he believed in it, but because it suited his career at the moment.</p>\n\n	<p>At the apex of the love affair, Jillian tells Guy why she&#8217;s leaving the country shortly. She has knowledge of an arms shipment scheduled to arrive in a few days, from the Chinese to the <span class="caps">PKI</span> (the Communist Party of Indonesia), the ostensible perpetrators of the coup (although, in real life, it later came to light that the coup was entirely an internal Army one, intended to preserve Sukarno&#8217;s power). She tells Guy in order to protect him, so that he&#8217;ll leave with her and get out of harm&#8217;s way. Jakarta will not be a friendly place to foreigners once violence erupts. Instead, Guy sees this as the big story he&#8217;s been looking for, and he doesn&#8217;t care if it puts him in danger or compromises Jill&#8217;s status at the Embassy.</p>\n\n	<p>Guy is a likable jerk from start to finish, never maturing or reconciling himself with those he damages, yet his charms make it all too easy to root for him. He puts himself and his driver at unnecessary risk by attempting to approach a military-controlled palace for an interview with one of Sukarno&#8217;s subordinates, which results in the bludgeoning of his left eye. When the coup collapses and Guy partially recovers, he convinces his loyal guide, who is <span class="caps">PKI</span> and thus at risk no matter where he travels, to drive him to the airport to catch the last plane out of Jakarta. While Guy plays the opportunistic observer, Billy is an active manipulator of events; he keeps a myriad of files on the people he cares about in order to be an agent of change while Guy simply records misery and takes a check. Guy and his fellow journalists represent the old imperialists, the exploiters of grief, characteristics Billy comes to associate with Sukarno as well.

(121, 1, '2010-04-26 04:42:53', '2010-04-26 04:42:53', '	<p><em>Beast Stable</em> may not be the most popular of the original Sasori trilogy, but it is probably the most accomplished in terms of storytelling, both visual and aural. This was to be director Shunya Ito&#8217;s final Scorpion film, again starring Meiko Kaji, who also sings the primary theme (Urumi Bushi), and a few characters from the previous installments. Ito (and the art direction of Tadayuki Kuwana) is less bold here than in <em>Jailhouse: 41</em>, with fewer camera sweeps and manual zooms, but it actually works in this film&#8217;s favor. Gone are the excessive lingering close-ups and the wild metaphors that made <em>Jailhouse: 41</em> so interesting yet so often tedious. Ito has shorn away the excesses while still conceiving of brilliant, eye-popping images and compositions; here the images are more effective because the editing is so much sharper, the pace striking the proper balance between the freneticism of <em>Prisoner #701</em> and the sober deliberateness of <em>Jailhouse</em>.</p>\n\n	<p>Having disposed of the one-eyed warden at the end of <em>Jailhouse</em>, Nami Matsushima is now trying to stay off the radar, but as the opening montage shows us, her face is being broadcast all over Japan. She manages to evade a couple of under-covers on a subway car by mutilating one and during the opening credits we see her dancing through the city with his severed arm manacled to her wrist. She finds a cemetery and successfully looses her cuffs on a tombstone, but collapses from exhaustion. She&#8217;s taken in by Yuki (played superbly by Yayoi Watanabe), who prostitutes herself to take care of her brother, rendered infantile because of some long-suffered cerebral trauma. Matsu is of course attacked by him at the first opportunity, and only Yuki&#8217;s abrupt intervention prevents Matsu from cutting him to pieces. When Yuki admits that she not only nurses her brother, but provides him with sexual release, Matsu reacts with a mixture of sympathy and disgust.</p>\n\n	<p>	Like all Scorpion films character is subordinated to aesthetics, narrative to formal associations. Matsu&#8217;s rational and emotional complexity is always under the surface, and not merely through any deliberateness of character, but it&#8217;s also obscured by her apparently superhuman perception, which Meiko signifies with her large, round, cold eyes. Her silent exterior affords us an opportunity to observe her mental processes through other characters, none of whom is able to contain their internal content like Matsu. She embodies an ideal of womanhood in Ito&#8217;s films, one of both relentless stoicism and providential wrath; ironically the women she pities possess the kind of emotional sensitivity and pliability that she yearns for and of which she is no longer capable. Like a Christ figure, Matsu is forced to maintain both an emotional distance and a moral clarity to do what has to be done, placing herself in the position of fulcrum between good and evil forces.</p>\n\n	<p>	While feeling sympathy for the invariably pathetic women she encounters, there is also present a resoluteness to leave them to a fate she feels is precipitated by a sadistic conspiracy of phalluses, but masochistically yielded to by woman. Matsu yields only strategically and her seemingly infinite patience allows her to win her battles down the road. Ito associates Matsu figuratively with the scorpion, an inscrutable creature of cunning and elegant lethality. When she learns of Yuki&#8217;s pregnancy, Matsu briefly considers killing Yuki&#8217;s brother out of mercy for them both, but it&#8217;s the forced abortion of another abused girl that convinces her otherwise. As in <em>Jailhouse</em>, abortion is both a subject of narrative consequence and subtextual, reinforcing the point that pitiless males have total control over the female body, and in both films Matsu unleashes vengeance upon a state that both fosters and enforces such practices.</p>\n\n	<p>	Matsu&#8217;s revenge on the brothel of the title and its mistress is photographed and edited together by Ito masterfully: we see one of her victims in a car emerging from a car-wash with a blade stuck in his heart, another hanged by his tie from a sleek office building&#8212;and they all exhibit the Scorpion&#8217;s marks; with montage there&#8217;s no need for us to see how it all unfolded. In another scene, Ito recreates the inebriated sense of time of a swank nightclub through clipping, or deleting strands of film stock to accelerate time and expand space; and the artificial lighting and colorful sets perfectly assist the nighttime milieu. Ito also better translates narrative ideas into cinematic ones in this film. When Yuki drops burning matchsticks through manholes and into the sewer to locate the fugitive Matsu, the director shoots them descending from every conceivable angle. Then with a smaller wide-angle lens he blurs their descent until a virtual firestorm of falling matchsticks consumes the toxic tunnels that Matsu darts through. It&#8217;s all of these little details of technique (you&#8217;ll wonder repeatedly how this effect or that effect was achieved) that further enrich the viewing experience, even if they don&#8217;t always inform.</p>\n\n	<p>If you&#8217;ve seen the first two of the trilogy, the fact that Matsu runs into and settles a score with an old prison nemesis won&#8217;t come as a shock, and neither will Ito&#8217;s treatment of the incredible ending. If you have the opportunity to see the trilogy in its entirety, you&#8217;ll understand Ito&#8217;s singular genius. The amount of variation in sets, characters, action, lighting, photography and ambience over the course of these three films is astounding; each has its own peculiar vibe and unique strengths. Overall, this is my personal favorite of the Sasori trilogy and a fine edition to any collection, exploitation or not.</p>', 'Female Prisoner Scorpion: Beast Stable', '', 'trash', 'open', 'open', '', 'female-prisoner-scorpion-beast-stable', '', '', '2014-08-17 17:01:22', '2014-08-17 17:01:22', '', 0, 'http://www.cinelogue.com/reviews/female-prisoner-scorpion-beast-stable', 0, 'post', '', 0),

While there is little to be said for its technical direction, though to be sure it is ably directed and written for the screen by Robert Benton, this picture&#8217; strength lies in its performances, furnished intelligently by both Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep.</p>\n\n	<p>Ted Kramer’ (Hoffman) obsession with his career as an advertising executive and resultant indifference to his wife Joanna (Streep) has driven her away. Kramer is left to raise their son of five years on his own. At first the two have an antagonistic relationship as Billy struggles to adapt to life without his loving mother and Ted is forced to sacrifice the work he loves to care for the boy. Kramer befriends his neighbor Margaret, also a single parent and the woman who advised Joanna to leave. She witnesses firsthand the transformation of Ted and Billy, who grow to have a tender relationship. A year and a half after abandoning her family Joanna returns to New York to reclaim her son. The struggle for custody ensues.</p>\n\n	<p>On the surface <em>Kramer vs. Kramer</em>, as the title implies, is a dramatization of a narrative we are all too familiar with in America; namely the tragic compromises that follow from divorce, particularly when a young child enters the calculus of what is ultimately a vicious legal battle. But more than that, at bottom, this film is about a man learning to be a father; to meet his encumbered obligation and live for something outside of himself. This allows Benton some license for humor: an early scene of Kramer attempting to cook breakfast for the boy resulting in a disaster of French toast stands out. It also allows Hoffman to express himself in some of the films more affecting scenes: reading to the boy before bed, dashing through the streets of Manhattan clenching him in his arms after a playground incident followed by a beautifully shot sequence of Kramer supporting his head and whispering to him while a doctor sutures the gash above his eye.</p>\n\n	<p>The truly transforming event for Kramer is the legal battle itself. He loses his job because of it and, to evince his competence as a parent before the court, is forced to find another job immediately. He tells his lawyer to give him 24 hours in which time he practically demands a job at another firm which pays less and for which he is overqualified. The trial montage itself is theater for some of the more arresting exchanges in the film but is also, unfortunately, unrealistically intense. The lawyers continually berate both of our titular characters, something that would never happen in reality, eliciting tears from Joanna when confronted with the accusation of failing at her every relationship. This may, however, be a necessary sin for a climactic reason as well as a thematic one and, regardless, the approach at least feels authentic. In these scenes the Kramers confront their demons and begin to question for the first time whether either one of them is fit to parent. They also realize they have both selfishly and childishly hurt the other for the sake of custody.</p>\n\n	<p>One incisive narrative feature gleaned from the courtroom is Benton&#8217;s strong statement regarding the legal precedence of awarding custody to the mother by default, a form of judicial discrimination that began to change by the release of this film and which is practically non-existent today. Without condemnation the director grants equal weight and consideration for both Ted and Joanna&#8217; views, while at the same time emphasizing the uphill battle for the father despite having cared for the boy for almost two years because the mother abdicated her responsibility. Ted, of course, bears some culpability for her departure as well as a moral burden for his prior neglect of his family.</p>\n\n	<p>This film&#8217;s major weakness, at least narratively, is the denouement. Instead of taking the obvious route of the boy going to live with Joanna, perhaps accompanied by a heartbreaking farewell between Ted and Billy, Benton decides to append a clichéd, feel-good ending. Ostensibly, Joanna&#8217; guilt leads her to reject custody and allow Billy to stay with his father. You can kind of sense this happening before actually seeing it on screen, but still you might be thinking, &#8220;no, it&#8217;s too obvious.. this film won&#8217;t succumb to that kind of &#8230;&#8221; and then it happens. If you&#8217;ve identified more with the father it&#8217;s almost vindicating, but still it leaves a bad aftertaste. Aside from that minor infraction, however, the film accomplishes the modest goals it sets for itself and, despite being grossly overestimated by the Academy (winning Best Picture that year over <em>Apocalypse Now</em>), is ultimately an entertaining and endearing picture.</p>', 'Kramer vs. Kramer', '', 'trash', 'open', 'open', '', 'kramer-vs-kramer', '', '', '2014-08-17 17:01:22', '2014-08-17 17:01:22', '', 0, 'http://www.cinelogue.com/reviews/kramer-vs-kramer', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Aside from a brief parole in 1982, during which he had a stint as a bare-knuckle fighter and took the better-fitting moniker &#8216;Charles Bronson&#8217;, he has been locked-up every day of his life to the present. Primarily known to the British public as a taker of hostages and &#8220;Britain&#8217;s Most Expensive/Violent Prisoner&#8221;, Bronson is both a subject of fascination and target of derision. Ostensibly directing a biopic, Nicolas Winding Refn has taken far more liberties with the man&#8217;s story than is ordinarily acceptable given that kind of genre limitation.</p>\n\n	<p>From the get-go, Refn challenges audience expectations. The opening sequence is genius, and perhaps the kind of amalgam of image and sound that couldn&#8217;t be more perfect for rendering the ugly, caged intensity of the male id. We know just how brutal a man like Bronson can be from the moment we see him performing his floor exercises&#8212;naked except for the grease or excrement that covers his muscled body and the intense red light that bathes every millimeter of the frame&#8212;later to be rudely interrupted by baton-wielding guards; over this balletic chaos Scott Walker&#8217;s appropriately forlorn composition &#8220;The Electrician&#8221; plays right up until the film&#8217;s title appears under a now fully-clothed Bronson staring evilly at the camera.</p>\n\n	<p>Addressing the camera Bronson tells us of his childhood and history to the present, but against expectations it is a very normal one (not too normal, he tells us; he experiences his fair share of violence and victimization). One can&#8217;t help but think at this point, &#8220;are they really going to attempt such an easy explanation of Bronson&#8217;s state of mind?,&#8221; but Refn does no such thing. When Bronson is finally locked up for the first time, he pretends to sob away from the camera before emerging with a terrible laugh, suddenly transported fully-costumed to a vaudeville stage in front of a fully aroused audience.</p>\n\n	<p>Refn makes some clever meta-reference to the first ten minutes of exposition when Bronson tells his theatre audience that he doesn&#8217;t think of prison as &#8220;not bad&#8221;, as &#8220;that would be misrepresenting myself, and I think enough of that has been done already, don&#8217;t you?&#8221; Bronson goes on to tell us about the guards he&#8217;s grappled, the various conditions in the lock-up, amusingly describes the accommodations in all the prisons he&#8217;s been passed around to as if they&#8217;re hotels, and goes on to clarify his position:</p>\n\n	<blockquote>\n		<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t get me wrong. For most people prison is tough, a monotonous nightmare; twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year of pure, unadulterated, living, breathing hell. But for me, prison was finally a place where I could sharpen my tools, hone my skills. It&#8217;s like a battleground, isn&#8217;t it? It was an opportunity. And a place where, soon, every native was going to know my name.&#8221;</p>\n	</blockquote>\n\n	<p>At this point it is made clear that what we are dealing with in this man is not a criminal, he only stole after all a few pounds, but a man who desperately <em>wants</em> to be in prison, and famous. He certainly commits a criminal act, but it isn&#8217;t clear if he even had live rounds in his gun&#8212;a shotgun we see him saw down to the length of a man&#8217;s forearm and then play with like a steel penis&#8212;and he only takes enough to justify wielding the weapon in the first place, perhaps assuming that armed robbery is a better charge than brandishing a weapon for no good reason for which he might just get a slap on the wrist, or be sent to the looney bin.</p>\n\n	<p>Bronson&#8217;s obvious machismo combined with the gunplay implies a latent sexuality, but Refn spends the remainder of the film sculpting a character who couldn&#8217;t be more asexual, at times resembling an impotent steroid abuser or a listless <em>and</em> impotent heroin fiend. It&#8217;s simply the first of many red herrings in a film that many will observe resembles Kubrick&#8217;s <em>A Clockwork Orange</em> a little more than superficially. It&#8217;s true we see Bronson engage in a few sexual liaisons and he even attempts a marriage proposal, but as the character repeatedly reminds everyone around him, he doesn&#8217;t know what it is that he wants. He certainly doesn&#8217;t have any ordinary notions of freedom. The loose redhead he wants to marry tells him he has no ambition, and to prove her wrong he steals an engagement ring.</p>\n\n	<p>The film suffers greatly on repeat viewings from a confusion of both tense and perspective. In attempting to defy expectations and comfortable behavioral explanations, Refn constantly changes pace; there is no dramatic denouement and Bronson&#8217;s confessional narration that dominates the first half of the film is abandoned or forgotten about for much of the rest. What&#8217;s left is a series of sometimes brilliant and occasionally surreal setpieces that raise more questions about the screenplay than they do the characters. Refn and his screenwriter clearly have some ideological notions in mind, but they are left underdeveloped and totally waylaid by Tom Hardy&#8217;s intense performance.</p>\n\n	<p>If I tried I couldn&#8217;t laud Tom Hardy enough, truly one of the most astonishing menaces to ever grace the screen; his entire body owns this character, even as we see Hardy at different stages of his actual training regimen due to a non-chronological shooting schedule. And when the script relegates his body to stasis, Hardy uses his eyes and his mouth to insinuate vast reservoirs of angst underneath. He has a way of breathing only through his nose&#8212;the sound of it is miked very clearly&#8212;which gives a sense of an ego that can&#8217;t be contained even by the limits of Bronson&#8217;s musculature, and ready to burst. Just incredible. And to the surprise of many Hardy&#8217;s is also a remarkably absurd and funny performance, making the character all the more enigmatic.</p>\n\n	<p>In the end Bronson basically becomes, in the words of the effeminate convict who takes him under his artistic wing, a &#8220;budding Magritte&#8221;. Refn wants us to believe some kind of transformation has taken place, but when and where I couldn&#8217;t reckon; the very mustache on Bronson&#8217;s face is the work of an aesthete, not to mention his physique. Nonetheless, the weird marriage of multimedia art and physical violence that takes place during the film&#8217;s climax is intriguing and prefaced by Bronson&#8217;s demand, the only time we witness him make one, for music.</p>', 'Bronson', '', 'trash', 'open', 'open', '', 'bronson', '', '', '2014-08-17 17:01:21', '2014-08-17 17:01:21', '', 0, 'http://www.cinelogue.com/reviews/bronson', 0, 'post', '', 0),

From its pages he gleans not only something about his family&#8217;s past, but some preconscious part of himself. What unfolds is a fable of personal and cultural demons, given record in the Iikura chronicle and exorcised throughout the generations.</p>\n\n	<p>	The chronicle of the Iikura clan first takes us to Jirozaemon Hidekiyo who commits seppuku after a military blunder to save face for his Lord. His son, Sijaemon, is ensured a handsome stipend that he soon squanders due to the inept servitude to <em>his</em> Lord. Sijaemon in turn commits seppuku, and splendidly, allowing the family line to continue&#8230; The chronicles gradually become more detailed and, as the narrator tells us, &#8220;bizarre&#8221;. Iikura Kyutaro is a samurai-in-training who proves himself an adept swordsman. His Lord fawns over him and promotes him to page, which means intimate services in the Lord&#8217;s bed chamber, a proposition Kyutaro initially resists, but eventually submits to for he doesn&#8217;t really have a choice in the matter anyway. Kyutaro falls in love with the wife of his increasingly cruel and jealous Lord, consummates that love, and is summarily castrated as punishment, but not before his progeny finds its womb. The Iikura clan continues&#8230; and so continues the cycle of the cruel Lord exploiting his dutiful retainers.</p>\n\n	<p>	The longest and most interesting segment is also the most brutal and emotionally charged, and it begins with a volcanic eruption. The eruption of Mount Asuma signals the beginning of the Tanmei period, marked by a pronounced famine which lasts nearly a decade. Iikura Shuzo, another adept swordsman, is promoted by Lord Tanuma and with a promotion comes greater and often undesirable duties: Shuzo and other retainers are required to put some poor farmers to the saw, an ugly, draconian execution, prompted by the collective farmers&#8217; direct petition to the government. Not wholly satisfied with Shuzo&#8217;s sacrifices, Lord Tanuma demands Shuzo make a gift of his daughter Sato, dressed up and delivered to Tanuma like a Kyoto doll, even though she has a prior engagement to the young, noble Kazuma. Shuzo reassures his children that all will be well, that &#8220;the lives of samurai do not belong to the samurai.&#8221; Still not contented, Tanuma demands Shuzo&#8217;s wife Maki, who opts to commit ritual seppuku rather than adultery. </p>\n\n	<p>Finally at his wit&#8217;s end, a blindfolded Shuzo is forced to unknowingly execute both his daughter and her fiancee with the &#8216;Sword of Darkness&#8217;, a blindfolded demonstration of skill invented by Shuzo and what first impressed Tanuma enough to promote him. Shuzo is shocked when he discovers his unintentional deed, but he nonetheless persists in his delusion: &#8220;To die in service to your Lord; that is the beginning of loyalty.&#8221; With these words Shuzo too commits seppuku. Tanuma laughs. This episode in particular seems to have a lot of echoes in the work of Masaki Kobayashi, especially <em>Samurai Rebellion</em>. Both feature characters pushed to the brink by their wanton masters and broach themes of loyalty, sovereignty and justice in feudal Japan.</p>\n\n	<p>Kinnosuke Nakamura plays all six of Susumu&#8217;s ancestors very competently, but his portrayal of Shuzo is simply a tour-de-force. Some of the compositions developed by Imai and Makoto Tsuboi, his cinematographer, are startlingly powerful, the camera always seems to know right where Nakamura&#8217;s face will be at its most expressive. Amazing stuff. Unfortunately, the rest of the film isn&#8217;t nearly as good as the Shuzo chapter. We are left with a film that is derelict in its total composition; what could have been a strong series of chapters threaded politically and ideologically with a synergetic impact is more like a sine wave that crests only in the middle. Fortunately, that crest <em>is</em> so strong, but it casts a shadow. It is a thematic microcosm for the entire film, rendering the other chapters redundant, and indulgent. Maybe Imai should have considered a series of films set in chronological motion that explore everything that&#8217;s present here, but in less haste. </p>\n\n	<p>Interestingly, the narrative comes back to Susumu and his fiancée <em>before</em> the prologue chapter. We are given exposition on their personal backgrounds and their relationship, and Imai makes the case that the behavioral predilections on display throughout the centuries in samurai culture have found a new home in the bureaucracy of the modern corporation. Susumu the salary-man and his fiancée work for opposing companies, and the loyalty of each to their respective company tests and almost breaks the confidence they have in each other. But Imai ends on a jarringly optimistic note: the girl awakens from her coma and the couple make amends and look to the future. Perhaps the director or Toei or their screenwriters sensed that the budding youth culture of the &#8217;60s would challenge the collective repose of social-hierarchical conceit and its accompanying narcissism and emerge, if not as staunch anarchists, then as individuals with personal bonds superseding national ones.</p>\n\n	<p>	<em>Bushidô zankoku monogatari</em> is straight-forward, no-nonsense, literary storytelling, to its detriment. We have chapters that are meant to parallel and reinforce one another, but not to stratify or obfuscate our thematic understanding. So there is plenty of redundancy here, but perhaps that subtly illustrates the point: Japan as victim of its own inability to learn, to grow. Its embrace of a ruthless patriarchy goes back centuries, as the film stresses pointedly, despite the kind of superficial changes that people often call progress.</p>', 'Cruel Tales of Bushido', '', 'trash', 'open', 'open', '', 'cruel-tales-of-bushido', '', '', '2014-08-17 17:01:21', '2014-08-17 17:01:21', '', 0, 'http://www.cinelogue.com/reviews/cruel-tales-of-bushido', 0, 'post', '', 0),

He is a terrorist, freedom fighter, idealist, monster, hero, a sham and a fool depending on whom you ask. What <em>Hunger</em> does so well is using this historical consciousness of events to its advantage, deftly handling and, drawing on, long established and firm beliefs. This is a delicate subject—one certain to provoke—and a bold undertaking for first-time director Steve McQueen.</p>\n\n	<p>Perhaps to its detriment <em>Hunger</em> is aimed squarely at a European audience, presuming knowledge of the events depicted. Given this McQueen could have divested his film from its politics (and in a certain way he does) but he doesn&#8217;t <em>quite</em> do this. <em>Hunger</em> elects rather to actively participate in the historical dialectic, but it does so from a distance, presenting both the Irish Republican Army and the British in a rather uncharming light. Of course this works to great effect for the rest of the world, viewers unfamiliar with &#8220;The Troubles&#8221; or the recent history of the <span class="caps">IRA</span> generally. We have no emotional investment in the struggle and therefore must judge what we are shown and not what we are not shown.</p>\n\n	<p><em>Hunger</em> montages the series of &#8220;political status protests&#8221; by <span class="caps">IRA</span> inmates from the mid-70&#8217;s through the early 80&#8217;s, culminating with the mass Irish hunger strike of 1981. Motive, like much else intrinsic to this struggle, is contested but the stated reason for protest is the crown&#8217;s removal of &#8220;Special Category Status&#8221; for inmates and subsequent refusal to acknowledge Republicans as political prisoners as opposed to common criminals. The film opens with the first of these protests—the so-called &#8220;blanket protest&#8221; in which prisoners refused to wear prison garments—and then proceeds to those that followed, establishing first the struggle without specifically commenting upon it (leaving most viewers in the dark) and second the prison system itself. </p>\n\n	<p>Interestingly, our lead is not immediately the focus. For the first half in fact his character is peripheral; just one man among many. This group is at first a collective: we don&#8217;t know their names, or their crimes, and there is no clear indication of which are Republicans. We are forced, in effect, to put identity aside and see them as merely &#8220;prisoners&#8221;. But before we see them even, the camera follows a prison guard inside and outside of the pen. Its a bit heavy-handed, but this is the only way we can possibly empathize with the “British” by suggesting that they have lives without, though they are lives infected with the violence intrinsic to their work. Following this one guard gives us a link to the external world (and its politics) and proves that one can never truly leave; that our actions can&#8217;t be divorced from who we are. However, aside from these brief sequences and an overdubbed British newscast the politics of the external world are dismissed in favor of the politics of prison life; verbal explication in favor of pictorial.</p>\n\n	<p>McQueen gives us, in effect, pure, intense, cinematic-visual experience, paced loosely but evenly. At times the aesthetic value of a particular shot may seem indulgent, even dubious, but collectively they are overwhelmingly effective. The grim atmosphere of prison life is built, as so many bricks, with intimate, vulnerable compositions, delicate camera movements; often in silence or near silence (the score being intermittent, quiet and subtle). McQueen renders his subjects from a distance in key scenes effectively alienating us. We are seemingly held captive between indulging the propaganda and identifying with these men qua human beings. The director creates and amplifies this tension, offsetting the emotionally distant and deferential shots with the very penetrating sequences of cell life.</p>\n\n	<p>The most striking of these must be the film&#8217;s treatment of the &#8220;dirty protest&#8221; where prisoners refused to wash and smeared the walls of their cells with excrement. At least one man does not merely smear, but rather crafts a work of art with his feces. The filmmakers insist on capturing this fetid, geometrically-precise spiral adorning his wall from multiple angles and for quite a long time; it even graces the cover of the <span class="caps">DVD</span> release.</p>\n\n	<p>We never see these men commit acts of violence but only hear the accusations of their captors. Instead we see them repeatedly brutalized in several scenes; one of them preceded by prison guards in riot gear beating their shields thunderously with billy clubs. This forms a strong aural motif, one present from the very beginning, but for the rest of the film associated with this brutality. A man later scrubs urine off the floor (that earlier each prisoner had spilled from their cells in coordination, called &#8220;slopping-out&#8221;) of a long hallway. The camera is fixed at the opposite end so that he steadily approaches the foreground, pounding the squeegee against the stone to the same staccato rhythm.</p>\n\n	<p>Another scene shows a vicious one-sided attack as guards drive a naked man (Bobby in fact) through several rooms to bathe, shear and shave him. Even the grooming is incredibly savage. This violence seems to be more poignant, more agonizing, than a typical action movie (with bullets, blood and gore) and it&#8217;s owed once again to the distance of the camera, and certainly to the dehumanizing effect of stripping the men bare in the first place. This will tend to create sympathy for the <span class="caps">IRA</span> for many viewers, but McQueen&#8217;s film can hardly be construed as an endorsement (for either side). The strength of their perseverance, and of Bobby&#8217;s in particular, cannot be denied, but tenacity is not the equal of righteousness or rectitude.</p>\n\n	<p>If the first half of the film alienates us from these prisoners, the second half humanizes them. In-between we get a nearly twenty minute scene serving as a kind of fulcrum. Most of the film&#8217;s dialogue takes place here, and McQueen uses it to realize the character of Bobby Sands; we learn his hopes, his fears, his ideas on justice, the church. The photographer places the lens at a distance, profiling priest and prisoner, where it remains (without cuts) for about 13 minutes during which time Bobby burns and sucks back three cigarettes (a welcome reprieve from his bible-paper rolled prison smokes). We also hear his plans for the hunger strike allowing the priest to punctuate the moral imperative. He asks Bobby if he&#8217;s resolved to die, if he intends to commit what he calls suicide, to which Bobby responds with a macabre childhood tale illustrating his moral clarity. But in here he is no priest, nor is Bobby a freedom fighter; behind these walls they are only men. The silence of the priest before departure indicates his acknowledgment of, even respect for, the moral force of Bobby&#8217;s conviction.</p>\n\n	<p>This scene will be much talked about, if not for its syntagmatic significance within the film then at the very least for the superb acting of Fassbender and Cunningham. They have a strong script to work with (for this scene is so engaging it may not feel like 20 minutes) but, regardless, it&#8217;s difficult to maintain character (and remember all of those lines!) for such a long time. It&#8217;s also an exercise in mise-en-scène, whereas the rest of the film is largely montage; the director carefully keeping us distant (and therefore unable to discern the actors&#8217; features) while the two shoot the bull, and then cutting to mid-shot to reveal their faces when they cut the crap and get to the issue at hand.</p>\n\n	<p>What follows is the hunger strike itself: a long montage of Bobby withering to nothing, refusing food, languishing in sick bed, ointment being applied to lesions. It is painful to watch, but it&#8217;s also probably the least interesting part of the film. And it&#8217;s hard to tell if these sequences were shot in such a way to give the appearance of starvation or if the actor did indeed subject himself to extreme weight loss. Either way, <em>Hunger</em> resolves itself by fulfilling its desirous title. Bobby is the first of several men to starve before the strike is called off, and history has recorded the rest.</p>', 'Hunger', '', 'trash', 'open', 'open', '', 'hunger', '', '', '2014-08-17 17:01:21', '2014-08-17 17:01:21', '', 0, 'http://www.cinelogue.com/reviews/hunger', 0, 'post', '', 0),

It furnishes a metaphysical, even a humanist, model—provoking a more profound moral interpretation from a genre subsumed by fantastical violence. The affliction of the lead necessitates violence to be sure but fantasy, for the most part, is flatly discarded. Unconcerned with vampire lore, indicated by form and early on with a somewhat more realistic than usual cause of the disease, <em>Thirst</em> instead beckons our attention upon the politics of sex, violence and virtue.</p>\n\n	<p>Immediately striking, and signaling a departure from convention, is Park&#8217;s opening sequence. Rather than an ordinary establishing shot introducing characters or setting, we get a parable of sorts with strong overtones of foreshadowing—and perhaps a dichotomy as well. There is a very large man in a hospital bed: near death, having slaked his arteries gluttonously for many years. Heavy of breath, he shares a story from his youth in which he overcame his strong <em>hunger</em> so that two starving children might eat. He asks our lead, a priest having entered mid-anecdote, &#8220;Think God will remember that?&#8221; and then he dies shortly after. This implicates the fate of our lead who, though he has yet to be formally introduced, has seen the consequences of succumbing to base desire and will shortly be burdened with his own appetites.</p>\n\n	<p>Thus, <em>Thirst</em> concerns the trials of this man: a priest named Sang-hyun, ably portrayed by rising star and Park regular Kang-ho Song. Sensing that something in his life, his service to the Church, or something in the world around him (poverty, misery) is terribly amiss he decides to volunteer for an experiment to find a cure for a lethal disease known as the Emmanuel Virus—one afflicting only men. Sang-hyun is the only man of 50 to survive a dose of the virus as a result of a tainted blood infusion. After recovering he becomes a sort of demigod, called &#8220;The Bandaged Saint,&#8221;  to the masses of his congregation&#8212;many of whom attempt to follow in his footsteps, boosting the number of dead dramatically. He soon discovers that he now requires human blood to satiate the latent effects of the disease.</p>\n\n	<p>The experiment in the beginning is a brilliantly executed accelerated montage, encapsulating months in less than 8 minutes of screen time. This tactic is employed to great effect elsewhere in the film, such as the rhapsody of blood lust overtaking Sang-hyun for the first time, and in Park&#8217;s other films; something he is fond of and also exceedingly good at.</p>\n\n	<p>Kang-woo is a new member of the congregation and, recognizing him as a schoolfriend, invites Sang-hyun to join his family Mahjong night. His wife, Tae-ju, is oppressed in their home; living as a servile caretaker for Kang-woo, who is enfeebled, and subject to a didactic mother-in-law, her life is misery. She slips out of the house in the middle of the night to run through the city streets—her secret and temporary liberation. She is immediately attracted to Sang-hyun, despite his relationship to the church, and he to her, but she attempts to repress her feelings as Sang-hyun struggles to chasten his new-found powers.</p>\n\n	<p>Once reciprocated, the sexual/violent escapade to follow propels the plot: Sang-hyun attempts a moral life, preferring to steal blood packets from the hospital rather than to kill. Of course the disease allows only a vestige of his former self for even stealing (and in this case from those who desperately need blood) is something he would never do as a priest. This may lessen the internal struggle because the story progresses in such a way that renouncing the church (and his humanity) is inevitable&#8212;the lingering question is not &#8220;if&#8221; but &#8220;when.&#8221; And indeed he does, steadily exploiting his powers, taking another man&#8217;s wife and soon progressing to murder.</p>\n\n	<p><em>Thirst</em> manages to glibly juggle its narrative focus: the supernatural is always in view, but for a film rife with blood and death the most engaging (and memorable) elements remain the troubling domestic life of Tae-ju and her liberating romance with Sang-hyun. On top of these sexual politics, and perhaps fueling them, a theme emerges: humanity is a fragile thing indeed and the good life, even for the pious among us, must be cultivated. Justifying his first despicable act as necessary for survival, Sang-hyun steadily, and easily, drifts toward perdition. The vampire genre, then, is a means for these didacticisms rather than an end-in-itself (as so many other films are).</p>\n\n	<p>For some reason I imagined a vampire tale beneath this director and therefore approached it with trepidation. Vampires are very bankable items in the oughts and it seemed Park Chan-wook might be cashing in as he did with his timely vengeance trilogy (which were, to me, in vogue at the time thanks to films like <em>Kill Bill</em>). I do not intend to disparage his earlier work (or its fans) for those films are certainly worthy of praise. Honestly, I wasn&#8217;t sure what to expect from this director after his epic vengeance trilogy. If nothing else, he <em>has</em> succeeded here in inverting expectation by offering a very refreshing take on the vampire genre, filled with dark, brackish humor of the sort we&#8217;ve come to expect from this filmmaker and which only Park seems capable.</p>', 'Thirst', '', 'trash', 'open', 'open', '', 'thirst', '', '', '2014-08-17 17:01:20', '2014-08-17 17:01:20', '', 0, 'http://www.cinelogue.com/reviews/thirst', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Admittedly it seems somewhat more difficult to define than other genres like the Western or Horror, but the attempt is often co-opted by a tendency to dismiss as exploitation or worse. This is unfortunate, for some of the most interesting films in recent years (for instance Refn&#8217;s <em>Bronson</em> or McQueen&#8217;s <em>Hunger</em>) could be classified as prison-films, however we define them, and I see immense possibilities yet to be realized within this seemingly narrow category. At first glance it seems to be largely defined by its setting, but many prison films are set only partially behind concrete walls. Jim Jarmusch’s <em>Down By Law</em>, for example, has the concrete lockup as its central motif, yet only 30 of its 102 minutes are set there.</p>\n\n	<p>If we are to hazard a definition of the category a working one might be: “a film taking place in and dominated physically by a prison, in whole or in part, and often characterized by alienation, dehumanization and despair.” A number of films set in prison do not neatly fit this definition, but nevertheless the setting seems to necessitate confronting these issues in some way. The idea of prison can be used synecdochically as metaphor (for society as a whole) though more often the setting is exploited for its metaphysical potential. What better way to approach a dialectic of freedom than to deprive the primary subject of it?</p>\n\n	<p>At the very least we can see, and try to understand, how the other half lives. Most settings are somewhat identifiable and familiar in the general, but few of us know what’s its like to live in a 8’ by 12’ cell. In fact I would venture to guess that our perception of prison is largely shaped by film depictions of it.

The intersection of cinematographer Karl Freund with screenwriter Carl Mayer and director F.W. Murnau is a notable and propitious one; Murnau was at the height of his powers while Freund would go on to lens many more films in Germany and especially the United States. It&#8217;s debatable which of them is responsible for the film&#8217;s more unique attributes, but it&#8217;s also readily apparent that their combined talents made the work far better than the material might suggest on paper, no slight to Mayer&#8217;s dramatic skills. It&#8217;s a simple story, like any told through acting, lighting and set-design, but the reason for its success is its innovative camerawork. The story is channeled by Freund&#8217;s camera, which pans and tracks and throttles every moment of every scene.</p>\n\n	<p>The opening scene still dazzles. We begin on an open elevator descending toward a hotel lobby; the doors open and through the lobby we go, tracking toward the  luxury hotel&#8217;s great, rotating door. The lens here appears dewy as elsewhere, a quality both sensuous and dream-like. The rotating door may be the film&#8217;s most prominent motif after the porter&#8217;s coat, and the first time we see it we are taken through it like one of the hotel&#8217;s patrons to spy our hero, the porter (Emil Jannings), risking sogginess to tend to luggage in the torrential rain. Low angles establish his sense of superiority even among the affluent, and the space of the hotel is exaggerated so it appears the center of the porter&#8217;s universe. Words can&#8217;t express the power of the camera&#8217;s movements during this long scene. Depending on the account, it was either a baby-carriage or a wheelchair that dollied the camera. It simply has to be seen.</p>\n\n	<p>Coming out of the rain, the porter discards his rain jacket and now we see the source of his exuberance, his porter&#8217;s coat, a glittering gem of thread and button, the cynosure of every scene here on out. It resembles something military and attaches to its wearer prestige and rank, and accords a dignity not won by the man, for the porter is an aging cartoon, mustachioed and clownishly rotund. It becomes apparent that he&#8217;s too old for the job when he can&#8217;t lift a patron&#8217;s luggage without great difficulty. He rests on his haunches after this trying moment, the patron wags his finger at the porter&#8217;s superior and, just like that, he&#8217;s demoted, forced to trade his magic coat for the white blouse of a washroom attendant. A clever trick has the camera appear to track directly through the plate-glass window of the hotel manager&#8217;s office as the porter awaits the relinquishment of his position in the adjacent room.</p>\n\n	<p>The porter is a man who has put his soul into objects, foremost among them the pristine uniform with gleaming buttons that he worships, divesting himself of any sort of pride or exuberance that isn&#8217;t invested in the article. As a result, the loss of his position is not so much an insult to his abilities as a man or one of pecuniary concern, but it means the relinquishment of his most prized possession&#8230; into which he has transmitigated his soul. His first thought when stripped of it is not finding a better occupation or coping with its meaning to his life, but simply getting the thing back. His trek home after his demotion is another virtuosic achievement of Murnau&#8217;s when the towering hotel actually appears to fall over to crush the defeated porter. </p>\n\n	<p>Expressionistic touches such as this tell us something of his thought processes. The pathos of his agony is clear, so it&#8217;s not surprising when the porter devises to steal the coat back from the hotel. Wearing it once again, he successfully deceives his family and tenement neighbors into believing he still has his former rank; they won&#8217;t be subjected to his &#8216;nakedness&#8217; without it . But when his wife brings the porter his lunch and sees him in his pitiful garb tending the hotel bathroom, she belts out a Munchian scream into the camera as if she has just glimpsed the man in some frightful erotica.</p>\n\n	<p>When everyone in the tenement building discovers the sad truth, the porter becomes the butt of jokes; he still wears the outfit but it is a shell, a mockery, and his hunched gait only confirms it. The attitude of his neighbors toward him fulfills the fears pregnant in his dream a day before, a dream that has superimposed faces swirling about him, cackling derisively at his misfortune. There is another remarkable scene the morning after his daughter&#8217;s marital celebration. The porter, still drunk, daydreams of a triumphant return to the hotel, bedecked in splendor, lifting that nagging luggage over his head one-handed like an Adonis and flinging it in the air to the amazement of an affluent crowd. The frame is blurred, the camera tilted, and Freund tracks along with the porter through the hotel doors and among the crowd. It has all the surreality and authenticity of a dream, the camera movement and the lighting again are exceptional, especially considering the long length of the take.</p>\n\n	<p><em>Der letzte Mann</em> was the culmination of a series of so-called &#8220;instinct films&#8221;, of which Carl Mayer played a key role, a small generation of German silent films in the early &#8217;20s which similarly attempt a more direct visual conveyance of feelings, or <em>psychological drama</em>, and, according to German film historian Siegfried Kracauer, have the same thematic preoccupations: &#8220;they are laid in a lower middle-class world which is the meaningless remnant of a disintegrated society.&#8221;<sup id="fnrev3867429374d40650fbb12d" class="footnote"><a href="#fn3867429374d40650fbb12d">1</a></sup> I&#8217;m not sure what he means by &#8216;meaningless&#8217;, but aren&#8217;t the Germans harsh in their diction?</p>\n\n	<p>The entire film, with one exception, is without intertitles; the exception being an apology by the film&#8217;s authors for the epilogue to follow. The film ends ostensibly with the porter in utter turmoil, withering away in the hotel washroom, but the studio demanded a happier ending. So Mayer and Murnau obliged with a cynical epilogue that has the porter inheriting a vast fortune from a hotel patron who died in his arms; the porter proceeds to dine at the hotel in opulence, stuffing himself, smoking cigars and mocking his former nemeses. It&#8217;s not without its charms, and rather amusing today, but it can easily be cast off to enjoy the film&#8217;s more singular pleasures.</p>\n\n	<p id="fn3867429374d40650fbb12d" class="footnote"><sup>1</sup> Kracauer, Siegfried. <em>From Caligari to Hitler: A Psychological History of the German Film</em>, pg. 96.</p>', 'The Last Laugh', '', 'trash', 'open', 'open', '', 'the-last-laugh', '', '', '2014-08-17 17:00:37', '2014-08-17 17:00:37', '', 0, 'http://www.cinelogue.com/reviews/the-last-laugh', 0, 'post', '', 0);

It was also little understood by the general public. But writer Roy Minton knew quite a bit about it through his own experiences with boys, his screenplay forming the basis of a film for the <span class="caps">BBC</span> which Alan Clarke was no doubt interested in for its provocative content. Dealing head-on with issues as diverse as adolescent and generational violence, homosexuality, Christianity, bureaucracy and growing-up, Minton&#8217;s work was well suited to Clarke&#8217;s sensibilities. The finished film has since carved its brutal brand of revelation on popular notions of the punitive system in the United Kingdom and elsewhere.</p>\n\n	<p>Though originally produced for television in 1977, <em>Scum</em> was banned by the <span class="caps">BBC</span> for a time before the rights lapsed and returned to producer Clive Parsons. He and director Alan Clarke assumed bigger production costs to create a theatrical version. The two are based on the same screenplay and shot with a similarly gritty naturalism; the primary change was the subtraction of a scene where Carlin (Ray Winstone in both versions) takes a missus, a lad who will serve to emancipate his libido, a wifey to his daddy. Minton lamented the subtraction, as he felt it intimated a necessary vulnerability in Carlin&#8217;s character.</p>\n\n	<p>Carlin is introduced on a drive up the countryside, hands cuffed, with two other lads; one will inevitably be a target of racist derision, the other brutalized for his sheer delicateness (a trait later deemed &#8220;subnormal&#8221; by a screw). Carlin doesn&#8217;t seem any different, except we know a little bit more of his past which includes a scuff-up with a guard in a prior borstal. Here he seems content with scraping by unnoticed, but it&#8217;s precisely his reputation that will cause the guards to sic the resident daddy, Pongo, and his cronies on him. Cornered, Carlin has no choice but to retaliate. In a brilliant unbroken steadicam scene (one that anticipates Clarke&#8217;s extensive use of it in his later films), Carlin drops a pair of snooker balls into a sock, walks up to one of Pongo&#8217;s bullies and gives him a devastating knock to the temples before getting Pongo alone in the bathroom for a once-over.</p>\n\n	<p>While Carlin is the film&#8217;s ostensible protagonist, his rise to daddy, the borstal lingo for top dog, being the film&#8217;s only upward evolution of character, in fact the screenwriter&#8217;s real delegate is Archer (Mick Ford) who also happens to be the most flippant character, yet the most fervent. Archer&#8217;s wit, intelligence and equanimity disarms his captors while opening a universe for the spectator outside of the borstal. He&#8217;s long decided to agitate the establishment as much as possible during his sentence; declaring himself a vegetarian, refusing to wear leather on his feet, refusing Sunday chapel and using every trifle of the rule book against those who are to enforce it. He is a disruptive force and a clarifier for the audience, disentangling the myths the screws have come to believe about their station as he makes sage connections between them and his fellow scrubs, between the microcosm of their collective disenfranchisement and its import on the wider world.</p>\n\n	<p>Perhaps more than any other film in our spotlight, <em>Scum</em> narrows its gaze on alienation. Brutality is a given, and we&#8217;re subjected to plenty of it, but what is imparted more powerfully is the degradation, psychological and societal, experienced by such young boys: echoes of the oft-shouted phrase &#8216;name and number&#8217; will persist long after the credits roll. And the filmmakers seek to elicit feelings such as dread through contrasts, marked contradictions between straight behavior and the society that these young men occupy. The inmates are constantly given paradoxical instructions, led to believe one minute that they will be rewarded for their conduct and the next being slapped with time in solitary confinement. They are permitted some penurious outlets such as their weekly meetings with the matron or appeals to the headmaster which are neither efficacious nor are they meant to be. It&#8217;s unsurprising then that two different boys opt for paroxysms of wrist-slashing to solve their problems.</p>\n\n	<p>When the boys fight one another, it&#8217;s the one on the receiving end of blows that goes on governor&#8217;s report, the lacerations on his face betraying his participation in a fight. This creates an incentive for retaliation among the inmates, a battle for who can get whom on report. It also nurtures an environment of deceit&#8212;along with vengeance being stridently un-Christian values&#8212;in spite of the governor&#8217;s insistence on the borstal being a Christian mission. These values extend to the screws who are part and parcel of the provocations that occur; the screws act as bale merchants, pitting one boy against another and profiting from the schemes of the most powerful among them.</p>\n\n	<p>In a memorable scene that encapsulates the film&#8217;s emphasis on ironic failures in communication, Archer&#8217;s diplomatic appeals to Mr. Duke (Bill Dean) are met with cynicism. Archer opines that &#8220;more criminal acts are imposed on prisoners than by criminals on society&#8221; which leads to a discussion of alternatives to the punitive system. Archer suggests dialogue while Mr. Duke would rather lock-up anyone convicted of a breach of civility. Archer uses those remarks as leverage to point out the parity between screw and scrub, how each is stripped of his dignity and how each would profit from that acknowledgment. Mr. Duke, appropriately mistaking this earnest statement for insolence, scorns Archer&#8217;s insinuation that he is in any way the equal of a captive adolescent.</p>\n\n	<p>Another contrast is made with Carlin. His path is a marker for the meaning of success in a world of deprivation; his triumphs depend upon assertions of authority among and over the inmates, while those same triumphs demand submission to the authorities. His progress is a vale between these two conceptual escarpments. Carlin&#8217;s navigation is successful, but success threatens to turn him into a lapdog for the gurads and create a schism between his preoccupations to power and his devotion to his fellow inmates. Enough is enough when Davis, an object of sexual assault earlier in the film, commits suicide. Carlin furnishes an insurrection that results in the annihilation of the cafeteria and untold physical damage to the institution.</p>\n\n	<p>We think this might be a turning point, we see all the lads of every wing circling a precipice of capsized tables and chairs to the mantric, choral shout of &#8220;Dead! Dead! Dead!&#8221;&#8212;then Clarke suddenly cuts to the ringleaders of the uprising being tossed like children into their cells, faces bloodied. Then we go outside, the boys standing prostrate in military lines, defeated looks on their faces, as the governor lectures them via megaphone for their insolence and asks for a moment of silence for their &#8220;departed friend&#8221;. Over silent credits we have an unsatisfactory, yet expectedly grim finale.</p>', 'Scum', '', 'trash', 'open', 'open', '', 'scum', '', '', '2014-08-17 17:01:19', '2014-08-17 17:01:19', '', 0, 'http://www.cinelogue.com/reviews/scum', 0, 'post', '', 0),

He&#8217;s also quite the insouciant character. He at once coolly embarrasses a cohort while also flippantly dismissing an important figure in the underworld. This nonchalance, which is rather typical of action movie heroes come to think of it, endears us to the character. But we&#8217;re given the suggestion that this strong reason for liking him may also be the source of his downfall. And his hubris <em>will</em> come back to him in a devastating way.</p>\n\n	<p>The image I chose for this film captures a certain mood that may only be understood after watching it, but it does not capture the essence of <em>A Bittersweet Life</em>, which at its core is a very violent film falling neatly within the gangster/crime and action genres. We see Sun-woo utilize his taekwon-do skills to pummel several men as the opening credits roll, in fact. The first act on the whole has comparatively little of this; instead it develops character, nearly verges on romance and creates a kind of atmosphere of pathos that endears us to Sun-woo and prepares us for a bloody second act (and third). Once Sun-woo&#8217;s deception is found out, however, Kim Ji-woon kicks it in to high gear as sweet longing gives way to bitter revenge fantasy.</p>\n\n	<p><em>A Bittersweet Life</em> has been accused of favoring style over substance, indulging in cliché and even borrowing from Park Chan-wook&#8217;s revenge thriller <em>Oldboy</em>. Considered threadbare the plot is nothing new and it is certainly predictable at times, but I think there&#8217;s much more happening here to largely compensate these flaws. Kim Ji-yong&#8217;s cinematography is often mesmerizing and very much imbued with a personal style. The scene of Hee-soo in recital comes to mind. She is plying her cello confidently and when her section is at rest she looks up to catch Sun-woos eyes. But she also captures ours for she is looking directly in to the camera, a smile creeping in to her face. And the explosive action sequences, in particular, are choreographed and shot in an original, even dynamic, way and the very fact of their explosiveness makes what could be a dull viewing experience a hell of a ride.</p>\n\n	<p>Sun-woo is first attacked in his home (which is set up in a very clever way that should remain a surprise), taken to a warehouse to be hung from chains, brutalized throughout; refusing to apologize to the boss he has his hand squashed with a colossal wrench and then he is buried in mud—meaning he must crawl from the deep-six with only one good hand. The boss has him nearly killed, but he gives him several chances to make amends, the last of which Sun-woo takes advantage of to escape while taking out a large group of henchmen in the process. From skull-stabbing with a cell phone battery to slamming a face in to a wall and dragging it along the brick and hijacking a car to flee this character takes the tough guy persona to another level, surviving multiple stab wounds, gun shots and more and dealing death and destruction in response. I recommend watching at least this one sequence at full volume.</p>\n\n	<p>If nothing else, fans of gangster films (or fist and gun-play in general) should appreciate this film for its inventive badassery alone. The sequences of capture, savage humiliation and escape are particularly striking: rain falls throughout, evoking a sense of urgency and hopelessness at the same time; of course it is late at night so this is the least colorful part of the film, that is until the escape scene when the frame erupts in a furious blood-soaked array of fiery reds and oranges.</p>\n\n	<p>“If the hammer is light the nail will rise back up,” the boss comments to his associates in light of Sun-woos audacious escape. At this point the gangster myths are fully illuminated and you realize that <em>A Bittersweet Life</em> all along has attempted to turn the tropes of the genre on their head. He adds, “If the boss says you&#8217;re wrong then you&#8217;re wrong&#8230; even if you didn&#8217;t really do it.” The rules of the game, codified daily in the visceral, dog-eat-dog world of organized crime are here bluntly stated as a matter of fact. Director Kim Ji-woon seems to be aiming at satire while never indulging in it, the sporadic comedy sprinkled throughout this film hurled at the entire enterprise, mocking it at a distance. But a true satire would likely only blunt the sharp edge so skillfully honed here, that is the reality of the tragedy unfolding in the most violent ways imaginable. Instead <em>A Bittersweet Life</em> embraces black comedy, deftly scripted by the director himself and something the latest generation of South Korean filmmakers continue to weave so skillfully in to their work.</p>\n\n	<p>The bossman then furnishes an anecdote of a strikingly similar incident: “That guy lost his hand. One promising guy&#8217;s life ended just like that one morning. This time one hand is not enough.” Sun-woo, resigned to his fate, sets about eliminating the organization that fostered him and has now so degraded him. He purchases weapons from a cadre of Russian (or Mongolian?) arms dealers in a hilarious encounter that simply must be seen. The penultimate action sequence to follow grants the director one more opportunity for irony: as Sun-woo aims a pistol at his former master, three words adorning the bar become visible between their figures: La Dolce Vita. It&#8217;s my guess that this is a very clever reference to Fellini&#8217;s film, a work of pomp and circumstance deriding the self-indulgent aristocracy of 1950s Italy. The intended analogy could be that the gangster lifestyle too is absurd and our romantic preoccupation with it is painfully deluded. Perhaps it&#8217;s a relic of the 20th century best left behind. If this is true we can extend the analogy to include our protagonist who, like Marcello Mastroianni in Fellini&#8217;s yarn, is searching for a more meaningful way of life, one that, due to present circumstances and the rigor of his chosen lifestyle generally, he can never realize. This interpretation lends itself to the following parable which bookends the film:</p>\n\n	<blockquote>\n		<p>“One late autumn night the disciple woke up crying, so the master asked the disciple, &#8216;Did you have a nightmare?&#8217; &#8216;No.&#8217; &#8216;Did you have a sad dream?&#8217; &#8216;No,&#8217; said the disciple. &#8216;I had a sweet dream.&#8217; &#8216;Then why are you crying so sadly?&#8217; The disciple answered quietly while wiping his tears. &#8216;Because the dream I had can&#8217;t come true.”</p>\n	</blockquote>\n\n	<p>With it&#8217;s inventive choreography, sentimentalism, intelligent scripting, strong acting, clever interpolation of gangster tropes and it&#8217;s charm, <em>A Bittersweet Life</em> is an impressive piece of filmmaking.

The Coens have at last crafted a black comedy that both embraces and shuns their origins, while complicating them.</p>\n\n	<p>Presumably the year is 1967. Larry Gopnik is a high-school physics lecturer somewhere in the Midwest; your everyday married-man. His small, yet idyllic life is suddenly changing for the worse: his son Danny ignores his existence unless he needs the television antenna fixed, or money; his daughter is stealing from him to save up for a nose ring that he disapproves of; worst of all his wife has shacked up with an acquaintance named Sy Ableman, &#8220;a serious man&#8221;. Their relationship seems like a totally logical development to them, but to Larry it couldn&#8217;t be more sudden or incomprehensible. Since the camera would have us identify with Larry&#8217;s perspective whenever possible, their actions and their rationalities appear to us to be just plain weird. Obviously, Larry&#8217;s wife wants a divorce so he&#8217;s turned out to a motel. Sy dies suddenly and Larry, the meek bastard he is, feels obliged to pay for the funeral. With mounting financial pressures, Larry finally resorts to something he never before would have considered.</p>\n\n	<p>One way of looking at the film will lead to a conclusion of its comprehensiveness, what you might call the Book of Job interpretation. This is a rather simple category that leads to simplified notions of morality, Manichean in apprehension and Hebrew in aspect. Larry is a man struck by a series of mockingly ruinous events for which he has no explanation; his life has been one of reticent humility. With no apparent karmic reasonableness, then, Larry is dumbfounded by all that has befouled and befallen him. His appeals to the heavens include the protestation, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t done anything!&#8221;. Like Job his character is being tested by unseen forces, until, that is, Larry is given the opportunity to cheat. He takes the easy way out of a difficult situation and what befalls him next, at film&#8217;s end, will make his prior squalor seem like a prelude to the opening act.</p>\n\n	<p>The Job interpretation would appear to be an affirmation of Hebraic traditions—heed your elders, heed the law, heed not temptation—but it ignores the film&#8217;s most important motifs and avoids its subtleties of language, both dialogic and visual. Indeed, there are as many interpretations of the events depicted and the film holistically as there are interpretations of quantum theory. And to ignore the obvious preoccupations of the film such as causality, time and quantum uncertainty is to lose a great deal of appreciation for it. For if <em>A Serious Man</em> is nothing more than a didactic embrace of Old Testament morality, what enjoyment is there to be had from that?</p>\n\n	<p>Fortunately the Coens have given us something far from didactic, and a film not only technically competent, but rife with detail—so much so that even multiple viewings will hardly reveal all of its secrets. What we have is a modern tale, a post-Einstein, post-Freud one&#8212;not an Old Testament fable. I am sure that many reviewers will say, &#8220;this isn&#8217;t so much a film about nothingness as it is about nothing in particular&#8221;, yet nothingness <em>is</em> something, and so is perspective. This film is not pitiless, indeed it is very human. In spite of its distances, in spite of the irrationality that our protagonist faces, it is no less irrational or incomprehensible than real life often is.</p>\n\n	<p>One of the many facets tackled so consummately is the double-emphasis on communication and comprehension. Indeed we have characters attempting to either systematize, impose order upon or dissolve themselves from the responsibilities of reality. This intercourse with reality (and hence with the viewer) is best illustrated in a scene with Larry&#8217;s next-door neighbor, the alluring Mrs. Samski. She answers the door and gives Larry this thousand-yard stare that intimates sexual stimulation; her body language entire seems to intimate the same. Then she invites him inside for some tea, takes a seat next to him on the sofa and&#8230; offers him a joint. After a few hits it becomes apparent that Larry and the viewer both have perverted the situation; Mrs. Samski was simply high when she answered the door, her gleaming blue eyes were dulled by smoke, not excited by Larry. Larry&#8217;s perspective shifts considerably after his first taste of the devil weed. A police siren roaring down the street is heard by him before either Mrs. Samski or us. The audio-visual manipulations of this scene will be repeated in another memorable one when Danny attends his bar-mitzvah stoned out of his gourd.</p>\n\n	<p>There&#8217;s also a great deal to be said for the film&#8217;s ostensible synchronicities. Briefly, consider the following: the mysterious calls to Larry&#8217;s office from the Columbia Record Club—is it really his son Danny ordering records on Larry&#8217;s dime?; the confluence of letters that Larry&#8217;s supervisor receives telling him not to grant Larry a promotion&#8212;they appear to be the product of Sy&#8217;s scheming intellect, but there are other intimations; the apparent simultaneity of Larry&#8217;s minor fender bender with Sy Abelman&#8217;s, superbly rendered through parallel montage by the Coens—have we witnessed a synchronistic event or simply a &#8216;coincidental&#8217; one? The examples are numerous and there exists no final answer to their ambiguities. All that can be said for certain is that the Coens intend to breach our reality tunnels, beckoning us to take a harder look and to never take film &#8216;reality&#8217; for granted. They&#8217;re likely also having a bit of fun with the many viewers who, through imprinting or conditioning or faith, have confused causation with correlation.</p>\n\n	<p>So Larry commits a transgression against his conscience, one that harms no one save himself, but for the viewer to assume that this little transgression precipitates the terrible events that follow (or to assume this is the Coens&#8217; objective) would be a logical fallacy, a pitfall that the Coens have almost set them up for, but conviction in this kind of supernatural wrath is quite common in many belief systems. Faith, many faithful would argue, does not depend upon logic or reasonableness, but rather religious feeling, or an abandonment of reason altogether. But, and I think the Coens would agree, what is really being embraced is a rigid causality—an Aristotleian sense of time and a Euclidean sense of space. These are very old precepts, and <em>A Serious Man</em>, perhaps more than any film to date, is urging for a modern perspective, one that copes with the apparent scientific reality and abandons superstition. An uncomfortable perspective.</p>\n\n	<p>Yet it is also apparent that this film is not obsessed with trampling organized religion. Its Jewishness is pervasive and I don&#8217;t think it takes sides. Indeed, probably the sagest character in the film is the young Rabbi, who seems to understand innately that everything depends upon perspective; he possesses the kind of understated outlook one would expect from a Buddhist or a Yogi, or a disciple of Einstein. Yet this is obscured, intentionally, by the portrayal. Not only does he look rather silly but his advice—&#8220;Just look at the parking lot Larry!&#8220;—is taken by Larry (and the audience) as youthful naiveté and the scene as a result is committed to memory as humor and nothing more.</p>\n\n	<p>Speaking of which, it would be a gross dereliction to leave unmentioned the incredible humor of this film. Sy Ableman has to be one of the Coens&#8217; greatest characters, and one of the funniest in recent years. His relationship with Larry has such a genuine awkwardness and it is perfectly understated to make it all the more amusing. Remember, this is the guy who purloined his wife and, not only that, he has this soft-spoken arrogance that would make anyone&#8217;s blood boil. Sy suggests ever so benevolently that Larry move out of the house and into a motel called, ironically, &#8216;The Jolly Roger&#8217;, a dwelling Sy considers &#8220;imminently habitable&#8221;. Larry&#8217;s apparently racist neighbors are as amusing for their irrationality as any hair-triggered racist in real life and a whole host of smaller characters come and go who simultaneously add to Larry&#8217;s chagrin and make a comedy of the film&#8217;s blackness. </p>\n\n	<p id="fn5920177234d68757e99edc" class="footnote"><sup>1</sup> Stephen Vincent Benét, <em>The Innovator (A Pharaoh Speaks)</em></p>', 'A Serious Man', '', 'trash', 'open', 'open', '', 'a-serious-man', '', '', '2014-08-17 17:01:19', '2014-08-17 17:01:19', '', 0, 'http://www.cinelogue.com/reviews/a-serious-man', 0, 'post', '', 0),

The prisoners of this film are on the same side as the prison administration; they are British soldiers deemed unsuitable for combat and sent behind the lines to be corrected. The treatment they receive by their own countrymen, by the officer-guards who are themselves in need of corrective drilling and the corrupt administrators who have quotas to fill is hypocritical, cruel and holds a mirror up to the whole war machine and its absurdities. In World War II, fighting was a perfunctory vocation. In <em>The Hill</em>, it&#8217;s all a business, a bureaucratic hill in the middle of the desert.</p>\n\n	<p>Regimental Sergeant Major Wilson (Harry Andrews) is showing a new Staff Sergeant, Williams (Ian Hendry), around the camp grounds, telling him what he expects of him as an officer and what the <span class="caps">RSM</span> is capable of, in short his accomplishments as warden. The <span class="caps">RSM</span> gazes at his hill, specially constructed for him in the middle of camp, like a pharaoh at his pyramid; it is a monument to his prowess as a disciplinarian and he makes damn sure his new Staff Sergeant respects it&#8212;and like the film&#8217;s characters, Oswald Morris&#8217; camera spends a great deal of time gazing at the thing. </p>\n\n	<p>Two scrubs march up to tell the <span class="caps">RSM</span> they have been approved to return to the front; the <span class="caps">RSM</span> salutes them and has them march double-time with kit out of the camp. When the two reach the solitude of the desert they plop down on their asses and give each other a gleeful look and a big sigh of relief. Apparently front-line combat is a welcome occupation after weeks under the thumb of the <span class="caps">RSM</span> and his screws. Five new scrubs enter the grounds, again interrupting the tour, and are summarily summarized by the <span class="caps">RSM</span>. These fresh five will be put under Williams&#8217; jurisdiction and will be made to suffer for it. </p>\n\n	<p>Lumet spends the first forty minutes of screen time on continuous action, introducing all the pertinent characters and motifs, introducing the viewer to the pitiless hill and the sisyphean tasks that have to be undertaken upon it. The viewer will be made to climb the hill with the new prisoners until every bodily fiber rejects another movement. This is boring and grueling and exhaustive viewing, but weirdly fascinating. Over the course of the initial drills we are slowly made to recognize the prejudices of Williams, who obviously doesn&#8217;t like Jacko King (Ossie Davis), the Jamaican, is repulsed by Stevens (Alfred Lynch) the wimp and Bartlett (Roy Kinnear) the sloth and intimidated by the physical stamina of McGrath (Jack Watson) and Roberts. In addition, he feels an inferiority to the <span class="caps">RSM</span> whose faculties have been rough-hewn by long experience. Williams has a drinking contest with the <span class="caps">RSM</span> which he loses and then wins all in the same night. On a different night Williams will attempt the hill himself, finding he can only make two complete reps on it before collapse.</p>\n\n	<p>The demise of Stevens is the most sincerely rendered of the various tragedies; all he wants is to see his wife, he isn&#8217;t cut out for this business&#8212;everyone knows it, and so does he. But nonetheless he&#8217;s a man, and a soldier, and none of his officers doubt that he can be reformed, or formed rather, into a disciplined fighting man. The way this film depicts his physical and mental discombobulation, his fear and trembling, his exposed nerves, is both tragic and very real. Stevens is a stand-in for every young man who wasted his fluids in that war or any, and it seems as if Lumet has opened old wounds with his character. It starts with Williams, who smells blood right away. Williams is the first of a few sadists who like nothing more than a lad they can bring under heel. Soon enough Williams has Stevens trudge up the hill wearing a field gas-mask just for his amusement. Lumet takes us with him over the hill, first-person, gas-mask over the lens, heavy breathing on the soundtrack, and we experience all the disorientation that Stevens must.</p>\n\n	<p>Roberts feels partially responsible for Stevens because he gets him in trouble during inspection, having him rub whitewash on his kit to cover up its blemishes instead of just scrubbing it clean. Roberts also has a bit of fun with him when he begins &#8216;sleep-drilling&#8217;. But his death is a clarion call for the other men, especially Roberts whose basic decency and empathy extends even to his antagonists. When the entire camp is ordered to stand at attention for hours on end, enduring the sun&#8217;s rays, waiting to be inspected, he remarks to another scrub: &#8220;We&#8217;re all doing time. Even the screws.&#8221; It&#8217;s Roberts who challenges Williams, appeals to the humanist Harris (Ian Bannen), a screw equally perturbed by the wantonness of his peers, and petitions to the diffident and ridiculous camp Commandant (Norman Bird) to render a verdict on Stevens&#8217; death that doesn&#8217;t contain the word &#8216;accidental&#8217;.</p>\n\n	<p>The narrative goes in a strange direction with Jacko, who, out of some pressing metaphysical need, throws his hands up in resignation. He suddenly deigns to wear the British uniform or follow orders. He now considers himself a civilian. The officers are caught so unawares by his behavior their sense of authority is punctured; they can&#8217;t make him go to his cell, or march, or do very much of anything, and he has the support of Harris, who allows him to see the Commandant nearly in the buff. Luckily for the viewer, Ossie Davis transitions this character with great aplomb, so you may not even care, but there is a strong dose of unreality here in a world so dispassionate and bureaucratically organized. The military veil can only be sundered by a man like Jacko.</p>\n\n	<p>Probably the film&#8217;s strongest moments after the long, initial action take place during a semi-revolt in which the prisoners are chanting &#8216;Stevens&#8217; and making a clamor in their cells. <span class="caps">RSM</span> Wilson deftly diverts a full-blown insurrection, and it&#8217;s thrilling to watch as Morris films it from wide-angles somewhat above the action. Wilson self-assuredly lets the men out of their cells and allows them to blow off steam, and when the fledgling mob ceases he begins picking them off one by one with a mixture of seriousness and complaisance, with a tenor of ambivalence. Harris is there to confront him; he disarms Wilson with humor, simultaneously cooling the prisoners&#8217; ardor, but cementing their position against the officers. As a result, a handful are cherry-picked for drilling, but Roberts and Jacko get a shot at petitioning the Commandant.</p>\n\n	<p>The film&#8217;s staying power lies in the strength of its screenplay, the cinematographic choices and the performances of its actors, but a current of repulsion, a total disregard for viewing expectations will make it a difficult film for many to endure. The film successfully abstracts its ideas into drama, but its ideological foundations are ones of tedium, absurdity and alienation, difficult themes to broach let alone drive hyperbolically to sometimes illogical conclusions. Indeed, this is a film that doesn&#8217;t entertain so much as it takes you over the top and dares you&#8212;to confront, categorize and define it.</p>', 'The Hill', '', 'trash', 'open', 'open', '', 'the-hill', '', '', '2014-08-17 17:01:20', '2014-08-17 17:01:20', '', 0, 'http://www.cinelogue.com/reviews/the-hill', 0, 'post', '', 0),

According to a 1967 public opinion poll by the ministry of justice 71% were against the abolition, 16% were in favour and 13% undecided. But you, who oppose abolition, have you ever seen an execution chamber? Have you ever seen an execution?</p>\n	</blockquote>\n\n	<p>	Marking the beginning of <em>Death by Hanging</em> with a series of handwritten (kanji) placards, Nagisa Oshima wastes no time in communicating his opinion of the death penalty. He then narrates a documentary-style tour of the execution chamber as the condemned is guided to the noose to be hanged. The lever thrown, we witness the hanging from two angles, the second a disarming repetition in slow-motion. Thus begins Nagisa Oshima&#8217;s surreal, polemical, metaphysical and  very much under-appreciated masterwork.</p>\n\n	<p>The chamber itself, steeped in religion and possessed of the kind of lived-in austerity one would expect to find in a rectory, is sheathed within a modest building that looks like it could be a retirement home and located at the terminus of a gravel path that snakes behind the prison proper. Oshima uses the very first shot for an overhead sweep of the prison grounds and its death house—then he takes us inside.</p>\n\n	<p>A physician checks the body, still hovering a foot from the ground, to find that it has survived. The officials debate the proper course of action, their training clearly insufficient for such a contingency. The representational form has now become presentational in nature; the fact of an execution gives way to fiction. They resuscitate the boy, a Korean of Japanese parents named R (Yu Do-yun), discovering that he suffers severe amnesia. He has no identity, he hasn&#8217;t even rudimentary knowledge of the world around him. Due to a legal technicality, the condemned must have cognizance of their actions to be executed; everyone takes a side. The priest, convinced that the boy before them is no longer the R who committed rape and murder (for the soul of <em>that</em> R has ascended), pleads with the officials and admonishes them for their determination to try the hanging again.</p>\n\n	<p>Only the public prosecutor is divested. His all-observing eyes symbolize us, the viewers; near the action but distant, unaffected, only responding with brief comment to direct questions. He is charged with observing the execution and there he remains as the guards first try verbal interrogation and psychological games, before transforming the chamber into Brechtian theatre; taking us back through time to probe R&#8217;s childhood, the dutiful prison workers play the parts of his parents and siblings. At this point the film comes nearer absurdist comedy as the guards transmogrify into caricatures, going to great lengths to jolt the boy&#8217;s memory so that he may be executed again.</p>\n\n	<p>One man in particular, the prison warden, played by long-time collaborator Kei Sato, takes his work far too seriously—the kind of maniac Kafka might swoon for. With R&#8217;s refusal, or inability, to acknowledge his identity, this man, now completely immersed in the fantasy he has constructed, goes so far as reenacting his crime by assaulting an innocent girl. Oshima then throws spatial and temporal continuity out the window as we move from a focus on the death penalty to our very notions of identity and reality. Apparently, only the lead screw can see this dead girl. While trying to convince his peers that there is indeed a body on the floor she suddenly sits up, alive and well and claiming to be R&#8217;s sister.</p>\n\n	<p>She has a long conversation, or perhaps lecture is more appropriate, with R (or non-R)–and with the guards as one by one they perceive her presence in the room—urging R didactically to revolutionary Korean nationalism and hissing venom at the guards and, indeed, all of Japan. This dialogue seems to transcend time and space, moving from the chamber to an obsidian lake as in a dream while provoking the viewer to confront one&#8217;s conceptions of social hierarchy and the structure of political life. Oshima, after all, had much invested in the life of Chin&#8217;u Ri, on whom the character of R is based. He was an ethnic Korean born in Japan and had been arrested, tried and executed for raping and killing a Japanese schoolgirl in 1958. A book of Ri&#8217;s letters was eventually published showing him to be, in Oshima&#8217;s words, “the most intelligent and sensitive youth produced by post-war Japan.”<sup id="fnrev17123671154dee528059798" class="footnote"><a href="#fn17123671154dee528059798">1</a></sup> To Nagisa Oshima and his team of writers Ri&#8217;s crimes could only be understood in the context of his second-class social status, which meant suffering economic and social repression simply because he was Korean.</p>\n\n	<p>This film was released in 1968, barely a decade since the murder and only two decades removed from the Japanese occupation of Korea. The director boldly uses it to raise his voice against the death penalty and the racialism practiced by the authorities, the prejudice against Koreans being systemic to Japanese society. Of course, more than 40 years on, Japan retains the practice of institutional execution (as does the United States), but relations with Korea have improved dramatically (and even the death penalty may be reaching a tipping point in the coming years).</p>\n\n	<p>This is less a genre film—and therefore unique among the films chosen for this feature—and more the work of an auteur. It doesn&#8217;t attempt to deal with the issues confronting life in prison and it seems at first a satire of the death penalty and those opposed to its abolition only. But in the course of events, graduating from documentary to absurd theatre to surrealist fantasy in ever-widening gradations, <em>Death By Hanging</em> deals with sexual politics, race, religion, identity, a metaphysical conception of self and more. And throughout, despite the profundity of the increasingly absurd parody, Oshima insists upon its reality. He never draws us directly into the comedy/tragedy, and the film&#8217;s message is all the stronger for it. Like the public prosecutor we are kept at arm&#8217;s length to observe and afterward reflect.</p>\n\n	<p>This is surreal, self-aware, provocative and daring filmmaking. And Brechtian in every sense of the word. This even extends to Oshima&#8217;s use of handwritten placards at film&#8217;s open, something the playwright often incorporated into his epic theatre. And it&#8217;s interesting that this style&#8212;which emphasizes representation to induce rational self-reflection on the drama&#8212;rather than clashing with the non-fiction, documentary form, actually enhances the film&#8217;s total effect. By juxtaposing the two, conflating them even, we are led to ask ourselves if the reality is not stranger than the fiction. Oshima, in effect, begins with the concrete, the particular (the fact of capital punishment) and progresses toward the general (i.e. surreal, metaphysical), passing through realistic, though absurd, drama along the way. In the same way <em>Koshikei</em> progresses from indicting these particular, foolish men to indicting the entire body politic.</p>\n\n	<p>Unfortunately, Nagisa Oshima is largely known for his sexually exploitive (some would call pornographic) work: <em>In the Realm of the Senses</em> in particular and others like <em>The Pleasures of the Flesh</em>. Both are laudable but neither is as compelling as the four brilliant films he produced from 1967 to 1968, three of which address the colonization of Korea<sup id="fnrev6301943414dee528061f1c" class="footnote"><a href="#fn6301943414dee528061f1c">2</a></sup> with <em>Death By Hanging</em> being by far the most inventive, intense, provocative and experimental.

She stops, the camera moves in a bit closer, and then she begins to dance like a much younger woman as a drumbeat comes to life on the soundtrack. This seems at first to be some kind of introduction, and it is, but it&#8217;s also a mystery. The juxtaposition of shots to follow, which dive in to plot, give little indication and the scene is quickly forgotten as we are drawn in to the greater mystery: a murder has been committed and her son is the accused.</p>\n\n	<p>The son, Yoon Do-joon, is twenty-something, mentally incompetent (though the precise disorder goes unnamed) and completely dependent on his mother. He takes great offense to being called &#8220;retard&#8221; which he responds to with foot or fist. He occasionally runs afoul the law due to the machinations of his only friend Jin-tae, a local hood of some sort. By apparent happenstance, he becomes the prime suspect of the murder of a teenage girl. Lacking the competence to defend himself and with complete innocence he allows the police, whose only evidence is a golf ball bearing his name found near the scene, to extract a confession. The mother then takes responsibility for conducting an investigation to uncover the real murderer and vindicating her son.</p>\n\n	<p>With skillful pictorial economy, we immediately learn a great deal about the relationship between mother and son. Hye-ja is introduced (after the dance sequence) slicing some kind of herb with a blade while, at the same time, watching Do-joon through her store window. Motherhood means work; it means sacrifice, but she has always one protective eye cast upon her son. This is also premonition, for just as she watches a car speeds past knocking Do-joon down to the sidewalk. She responds immediately, cutting her finger with the blade in the process, darting out the door to her son, who is apparently unharmed, on the opposite side of the street. She has such a strong connection with her child it verges on the mystical. It&#8217;s the kind of thing that is difficult to capture with prose and Bong Joon-ho makes efficient use of the techniques of cinema to express it visually.</p>\n\n	<p>This scene is repeated, with a variation, a short time later. Dividing her attention between a customer and her son through the glass, she darts outside once again as Do-joon is hustled in to a police car (picked up for the murder). In the first scene it is she who is injured because of her son (slashing her finger during the hit-and-run), but in this scene it is Do-joon who is injured because of her. The driver is distracted by her giving chase on foot and never sees the van crashing in to them, sending the car reeling with Do-joon cuffed in the backseat. So their relationship is reciprocal; one bound inexorably to the other.</p>\n\n	<p>Bong Joon-ho goes to great lengths, including the aforementioned scenes, to express the intimacy, the oneness, of mother and son. The profundity of which may be fathomed in the fact of sleeping together; it is even, and most strongly, to be found emanating from her face. Kim Hye-ja dominates this character, and by extension the entire film, with her face—and especially her eyes—more than anything else. She has a striking beauty for a woman in her fifties and despite the well-worn features that come with motherhood. There&#8217;s also a hilarious scene of her chasing after Do-joon to give him his medicine. He&#8217;s pissing against a wall while waiting for a bus so she takes the opportunity to pour the liquid down his throat as urine issues down the alley.</p>\n\n	<p>It&#8217;s hard to imagine a more striking, and honest, portrayal. A brief perusal of the actresses credits yields a short list—one interestingly filled with mother roles (her characters&#8217; names often just &#8216;mother&#8217; or some variation)–so it may be that she has relatively little training and perhaps this accounts for the seemingly effortless and realistic performance she gives. Whatever the case, Bong extracts a powerful performance from this actress, the kind that could easily mean an Academy Award for someone like, say, Meryl Streep.</p>\n\n	<p>This can&#8217;t be understated. In the Hollywood system, at least since the mid-40s, women have overwhelmingly been accessory, exploited sexually or in other ways; or if they are treated with a measure of respect it&#8217;s often simply because they are cast in a typically masculine (read: heroic) role (think <em>Thelma and Louise</em>). While Bong uses this character metonymically, as a representation of mother&#8217;s everywhere, he never exploits. He treats this character with tenderness, taking great care to encircle her, capturing her emotionally, intellectually and psychologically from every angle. This is an exciting and refreshing development for Western eyes&#8212;even for those of the East, for while Korea is not precisely invested of this legacy, it is no less true for Asian cinema than American.</p>\n\n	<p>While this story begins and ends with one woman, in-between Bong certainly strays (to its benefit) from the heart of the film, at times playing with memory and perception, exploring teenage sexuality and youth politics, Korean class hierarchy, and police abuse/ineptitude once again as he did with <em>Memories of Murder</em>. And all of this is captured in striking and idiosyncratic ways. The kind of frame compositions less interested in symbolism than evocation.</p>\n\n	<p>This director is truly charting his own path through cinematic art. He has so far consistently produced not only great films, but genre-blending, humorous, endearing and beautiful works of art; exploiting genre and character types as needed and employing convention only when inevitable—when it&#8217;s more useful or convenient perhaps than his own conception. At the risk of seeming trite, I name Mr. Bong Joon-ho among the most brilliant of new talent, and at the very least the most important director working in Korea. With the aplomb of a master he reinvented the murder-mystery with <em>Memories of Murder</em>, also reinvented the monster-thriller (crafting an amusing and affecting family portrait) with <em>The Host</em> and with <em>Mother</em> he&#8217;s reinvigorated the mother/son relationship on film, simultaneously giving us one of the most moving and provocative portraits of a woman and a mother yet recorded.</p>\n\n	<p>For his coda the director returns to where we began. Hye-ja is on a bus at sunset and, with the same score from film&#8217;s opening, she follows the lead of the other women dancing up and down the aisle. This is a beautifully, and boldly, shot sequence; one apparently using a telephoto lens at great distance, following the moving vehicle. It is jittery, in-and-out of focus, but spellbinding as if the camera too is enraptured, taken in by the rhythm as the characters are. The opening sequence now seems to say: &#8220;this is a story of a woman,&#8221; while her body condenses and explicates her story through dramatic dance. It also seems to signify a measure of liberation for a woman who has just, at great cost, spared her son an unenviable fate.</p>', 'Mother', '', 'trash', 'open', 'open', '', 'mother', '', '', '2014-08-17 17:01:20', '2014-08-17 17:01:20', '', 0, 'http://www.cinelogue.com/reviews/mother', 0, 'post', '', 0),
(143, 1, '2010-06-04 16:46:50', '2010-06-04 16:46:50', '	<p>Perhaps the most prototypical prison film in our spotlight, <em>Le trou</em> also happens to be one of the best of that category that favors escapes and derring-do. Director Jacques Becker developed the screenplay with the help of José Giovanni, the writer of the novel upon which it is based. Giovanni himself was an inmate once sentenced to death&#8212;the sentence was remanded to twenty years hard labor, a term during which, in 1947, he would attempt an escape with other prisoners. Giovanni&#8217;s fellow collaborator in the escape attempt, Roland Barbat (also known as Jean Keraudy), was used in Giovanni&#8217;s novel and was later cast to play the selfsame role in Becker&#8217;s film, in which he excels as the ringleader. Giovanni would go on to write <em>Le Deuxième Souffle</em>, adapted to the screen for Jean-Piere Melville&#8217;s film of the same name, and would later direct films himself.</p>\n\n	<p>Not uncommon in prison films, <em>Le Trou</em> begins on the outside with a brief, direct glimpse of the prison in its breadth among other Parisian edifices, inconspicuous save for the vertical bars of the windows. Far later in the film a climactic moment occurs that recalls it perhaps, but less attentive viewers will forget it for it will be swallowed in the film&#8217;s temporality and by its total mis-en-scene. But for now Becker takes us inside for an introduction. We quickly meet four cellmates, and a fifth, a D&#8217;Artagnan who has been forcibly moved to their cellblock due to repairs in his. The four are model inmates, tough and well-mannered, almost kind, but they don&#8217;t know if they can trust the newcomer, Claude Gaspard (Marc Michel). Much of the film will revolve around the confidence or lack of it between the four and their interloper, who seems to have his own orbit.</p>\n\n	<p>Roland (Jean Keraudy), who looks like a boxer, is the imposing veteran of the group, having made several successful escapes in the past he&#8217;s the natural choice to direct the operation. Manu (Philippe Leroy) has equal muster though less experience and is sort of a second-in-command and spiritual leader of the group. Geo (Michel Constantin) has the physicality of an athlete, but is lazy and content to follow directions. Vossellin (Raymond Meunier) goes by the nickname of Monseigneur, though his irreverence would lead one to disbelieve any religious devotion, and serves the function of cooling heads with his wit and warmth. </p>\n\n	<p>The four are like adopted brothers, and their bonds become increasingly apparent to us through their interactions with Claude. Hardly ever talking about themselves so much as each other, they introduce one another&#8217;s peculiarities and eccentricities to Claude, who, by contrast, seems to only give voice to his own feelings, telling the boys at great length about his life outside and the circumstances that have brought him to this fateful avenue. The film forces the viewer to identify with Claude for these reasons and others, namely his kindly nature so often remarked upon by the prison director (André Bervil), as well as his apparent innocence of the crime he&#8217;s accused of and his apprehension to violence. Becker is setting us up for something.</p>\n\n	<p>This is a strong cast of non-professionals and a capable crew, both obviously fully committed; the film possesses a completeness, a technical finesse on every level, and it has a pulse, but many of the film&#8217;s joys and revelations lie in the script, or are chiseled out of it by the deft hands of its editor. As one might expect from an adaptation of a true-to-life novel, there are details abound, sensorial minutiae at every glance, and in conjunction forming something in the mind of the viewer less corridor-like than arabesque. Note: if one has had the misfortune of enduring Bresson&#8217;s <em>A Man Escaped</em> and has come to some lofty conclusions about its merits, mark the contrasts:</p>\n\n	<p>Becker has us endure with the characters the tension, the noise, the physical weariness of forming the nascent hole in a single take no less than three and one-half minutes, focusing at a high angle on the boys as they take turns at the concrete floor. Shots like this one will be repeated aplenty; Becker&#8217;s almost nodding at us, letting us know time and motion still exist outside of his camera even as it&#8217;s still trained on something, though for normal purposes he could cut away, montage it into oblivion. We also watch as an officer dissects, with surgical fluidity, the care packages of the prisoners; though we get the idea immediately it&#8217;s still fascinating to watch him have a go at it, using a single non-serrated blade to excavate the carefully wrapped treats and toiletries. And then something that would seem to unconsciously jab at an earnest motif in Bresson&#8217;s film, we see the prisoners pressing against their window bars to pass along information and goods laterally, but instead of the conveniences of a courtyard with patrolling magi, the inmates have to get clever, swinging a slip-knotted rope from one cell to the next to reel in their contraband. Rather than a plot contrivance, a scene like this one gives flesh to the bone and seems to say &#8216;this is just one ingenuity among many, one way the prisoners elude their confinement&#8217;.</p>\n\n	<p>Without getting into too much of an undressing of <em>A Man Escaped</em> by comparison, it may be worth mentioning one more salient detail. Unlike that much-esteemed and better-known film, <em>Le trou</em> takes the viewer, logically, through the tall procedure of tracing the proposed escape route. In one of the film&#8217;s longest and most thrilling scenes, Roland and Manu have gone into the finished hole to explore the corridors below to find a sewer system through which to escape. Becker takes care with this scene as with others to render its temporality homogenous. Cuts are only ever employed to take us closer to the action, or further away, whatever the case may be, or to alternate the angle of viewing, but never time&#8212;we are with the two men every second of the way; the emphasis on timing is most evident when the boys later devise an hourglass to assist their work.</p>\n\n	<p>Roland and Manu slink their way through the prison&#8217;s underbelly, cutting through bars and doors, evading patrolmen, fashioning a master key with discarded materiel, lighting their way with a tincture of oil in an inkwell, walking steadfast through the shadows to their destination, the sewer. The plan is not set in stone; it unfurls like a flag and is subject to the whims of the breeze, and Roland with all his experience compasses it and makes his map accord with chance. Becker takes us on a memorable journey with them and with the others as they make their way into the sewer two by two, alternating their heft on the wall that separates them from freedom. </p>\n\n	<p>In one of the most breath-stealing climaxes I&#8217;ve ever seen, it&#8217;s Manu and Claude who first glimpse freedom, lifting a manhole to see the prison, at night, from the outside, and this time around we are looking up at only a portion of it. Having gone along for the ride, coming to know these men, it&#8217;s hard not to feel the same excitement these two feel. Claude feels compelled to give throat to his joy, wanting to take a taxi as it saunters past, while Manu stares silent as he is wont to do, thinking only of his brothers tarrying in their cell. If you&#8217;ve really invested yourself into the film, anger is the only emotion that&#8217;s relevant during the finale. Manu wants to wring Claude&#8217;s neck and so do we; there&#8217;s a righteous indignation that hovers in clouds. Never have I wanted so badly for a bunch of lifers to get away with it. In the diegesis of <em>Le Trou</em>, freedom is a taint.</p>', 'Le trou', '', 'trash', 'open', 'open', '', 'le-trou', '', '', '2014-08-17 17:01:20', '2014-08-17 17:01:20', '', 0, 'http://www.cinelogue.com/reviews/le-trou', 0, 'post', '', 0),

It is long, perhaps overly-long, montage set to a poor rendition of &#8220;&#8221;. In fact these sequences would probably be more effective with no music accompaniment at all. But this early failure will be reconciled. This is such a long film that that in itself explains in part why we come to know, and empathize with, these characters so well by the end.

(149, 1, '2010-06-30 00:30:31', '2010-06-30 00:30:31', '	<p>For the final installment of our prison feature we bring you the first film from Australian filmmaker John Hillcoat, who would years later go on to achieve some recognition for the elegiac western <em>The Proposition</em> and, more recently <em>The Road</em>, an adaptation of Cormac McCarthy&#8217;s despairing, post-apocalyptic novel of the same title. As in those films, he works with Australian punk idol and balladeer Nick Cave, who co-wrote and composed the score for <em>Ghosts&#8230; of the Civil Dead</em>, penned <em>The Proposition</em> and provided the score and also scored <em>The Road</em>. And like <em>The Road</em> this film too is futuristic, making it unique among our selection of prison films. A title sequence from the prison log files establishes setting: a remote facility located somewhere in the feral deserts of Australia. We are told it houses the most deranged and dangerous convicts in the country.</p>\n\n	<p>We are introduced to a seemingly docile bloke by the name of Wenzil (David Field in what is clearly his first role), who, probably to the films detriment, quickly becomes the focus—Hillcoat will smartly shift focus away from him shortly to the individual inmates. He undergoes the standard initiation: sheared, shaved, dressed and thrown in to the lockup. He intuits that it’s best to keep his mouth shut in this place and as a result speaks very little throughout. Wenzil is brought up to speed by a chain-smoking veteran, a guy who seems to shepherd virgin inmates, advising him to “watch your back in here. Oy! Watch your back I said.”</p>\n\n	<p>The game rules of the prison established, <em>Ghosts&#8230; of the Civil Dead</em> largely lurches forward; its plot is loose (inconsequential really) and for a long time a string of surly vignettes provides the meager and much needed momentum. There&#8217;s no cohesive narrative, at least in the first act, to make it compelling. Hillcoat simply shows us the game and how it&#8217;s played, then moves from one cell soliloquy to the next, each presented as the thoughts of the various inmates. This device works quite well in this setting, highlighting as it does the alienation and forlornness (and in some cases balefulness) of its denizens. It also means character development without needless dialogue, something accomplished further with consistently placed prison journal entries describing some events too expensive for this shoot.</p>\n\n	<p>Through these vignettes, however, a plot <em>does</em> eventually emerge. By halfway the screws become suspect. They seem to be provoking the inmates to violence through various means. It begins with the confiscation and destruction of personal property (including a drug raid), profligate cavity searches and eventually taking their television sets as well. We are shown a table shot of various drugs and every manner of smoking and injecting device: various needles, pipes, lighters, spoons, etc. The digital log informs us that a man was brutally murdered (stabbed 72 times) in the outdoor recreation yards by two men&#8230; with the rumor that the administration gave orders for an aboriginal (black) to rec with two known black killers. They bring in psychos from another cellblock, including a cackling, obscenity spewing bastard played schizophrenically by Nick Cave (in a way the role is a perfectly logical extension of his stage persona with the Birthday Party and others). “Kill me! Kill me! Kill me! Come in here and fuckin&#8217; try to kill me!” he screams from his cell, the director framing him against a wall with a smeared blood caricature of a penetrated woman behind his head.</p>\n\n	<p>One inmate even scolds the administration from the newly constructed indoor recreation area (read: chain-link cage) accusing them of intentionally inducing psychosis which makes one “become predatory&#8230; compulsive!&#8221; He continues, saying:</p>\n\n	<blockquote>\n		<p>&#8220;Do you know what you&#8217;re doin here? Do ya? You are creating a lot of angry men is what you&#8217;re doing. And one day those men are gonna go out there&#8230; and that day those people, out there, are gonna pay for what you are doing in here. You remember that!”</p>\n	</blockquote>\n\n	<p>It&#8217;s uneven but also disturbing, violent and visceral cinema. From Lilly, a long-haired man with a feminine frame who copes with prison life by assuming the role of a cross-dressing prostitute; to the clever system of note passing (attaching a folded note to one end of a string and finger flicking it under the cell door using centrifugal force to swing it to the adjacent cell); to the profligate use of heroin, the crude tattooing guns, the brutal beatings over territory and theft. In hindsight, though it may be a necessary bromide of the genre, it was wise of Hillcoat to establish the prison economy early (cigarettes, tattoos and sex being the most marketable commodities) for it is largely the deprivation of these luxuries that bears responsibility for driving the prisoners to desperation (and the plot forward).</p>\n\n	<blockquote>\n		<p>“October staff reports indicate that 11 inmates required medical attention due to acts of self mutilation. Upwards of 30 inmates commenced hunger strikes and that several fires were lit within the prison.” &#8211; Prison log</p>\n	</blockquote>\n\n	<p>It&#8217;s a very (at least seemingly) nihilistic portrait, a microcosm of a dystopian society. We are guided through, witness the deterioration of order and sanity culminating in a brutal murder&#8230; and then it&#8217;s forgotten. The conspiracy among the head screws and whoever else above them has apparently succeeded, the result of which is that the prison is to be destroyed and replaced with a much larger (and more expensive) one and five men are released (for no particular reason, or at least not perceived by me), including the lead. He returns to the &#8220;civilized&#8221; world, remarking mysteriously: &#8220;One man released so they can imprison the rest of the world.&#8221;</p>\n\n	<p>All in all, <em>Ghosts… of the Civil Dead</em> is untempered but it&#8217;s also audacious and eminently disturbing. With the filmmakers wanting for the purse they nevertheless crafted a gritty, brutally realistic portrait given what they had to work with. Aside wanting for a more compelling narrative this film falls short technically as well; the digital log readouts a banal attempt to transport us to the future for one. It doesn’t work, and the surprisingly bright, incongruous, Technicolor-like environs come off as shabby and hackneyed. Despite its numerous flaws, and the difficulty in viewing at times, it’s still somehow realistic and engaging (thanks largely I&#8217;m sure to its clever subtleties and the intimate plumbing of convicted minds) and rather remarkable for a first time director.

(150, 1, '2010-06-22 03:23:30', '2010-06-22 03:23:30', '	<p>There are certainly many remarkable things about Henri-Georges Clouzot’s <em>Le corbeau</em>. Only the man’s second feature as a solo director the film emerges fully formed and expertly polished with all the control of a seasoned veteran. A decade or so of experience as a scriptwriter obviously served him well. Alongside that it is dark, vicious and seething with all manner of social ills all while being made in a France that languished under the control of the Nazis. Occupation or no, seemingly the most remarkable thing about Clouzot’s film is that it managed to be made at all.</p>\n\n	<p>Under the Nazi regime all French cinema had to be submitted for approval to a board made up of ranking members of Vichy society; usually army generals, priests, politicians and other social figureheads. Such a board as this would have quickly caught Clouzot’s remarkably dark tale of a small French village that turns upon itself under a wave of poison-pen letters. However, this film came into being under the auspices of Continental-Films, a German production company. Continental-Films had basically been founded by the Nazi party and was headed up by Alfred Greven with the specific goal, set by Goebbels himself, of producing light and purely entertaining films to distract the French masses from their plight as an occupied nation. Greven agreed to the mission statement but had ideas of his own. It would seem that while he wished to comply with Goebbels’ request he did recognise a duty and an opportunity to make great cinema. So it was that Greven strove for and maintained standards that led to the production of numerous quality films even if they did not stir the French people to rise against (apparently one such film he supervised did suggest national pride and Goebbel’s quickly banned it even while citing it as a magnificent production). So, with a Continental-Films production logo, Clouzot’s film escaped the hurdle of a meddling Vichy regime.</p>\n\n	<p>The film’s story is actually based on a real life incident that occurred in Tulle, France in the 1920s. In that town a series of poison-pen letters, anonymous messages that revealed hidden information and gossip to all and sundry, sent shockwaves through society and threatened social order<sup id="fnrev16070200624d67f0e691cac" class="footnote"><a href="#fn16070200624d67f0e691cac">1</a></sup>. In Clouzot’s hands the film takes on all kinds of different shades. Set in an unnamed provincial village the setting suggests a detachment from the rest of the world that makes this society nowhere and everywhere. Everyone knows everyone else and so, when illicit details come to be revealed, the fallout is considerable. Such is Clouzot’s expert touch that the film effortlessly supports a large central cast. Chief among them is the doctor Rémy Germain, played by Continental-Film’s biggest star Pierre Fresnay. Alongside him we have psychiatrists, nurses, lovers, seductresses, townsfolk both young and old and Le corbeau (The Raven) him/herself, the cause of all this trouble. Germain has gained something of a reputation as an abortionist after a few difficult deliveries led him to choose the life of the mother over the child. Meanwhile, morphine has gone missing from the hospital’s supply room and money from the post office’s till. Le corbeau seems to see and know all and reveals it through hundreds of letters sent to all within the village. The result is a town torn apart by infighting, suspicion, hatred and greed.</p>\n\n	<p>Moving away from revealing any specifics of the plot, which plays out like a tense detective piece, it is still amazing that Clouzot’s film managed to be completed and released. It may have stepped over the barrier of Vichy censorship but Greven’s willingness to display this film, even if he did fire Clouzot after its completion, does speak to a love of great cinema that obviously runs contrary to the edict of the Nazi Party. The central moral dilemma is that Le corbeau is often telling the truth, even while it damages all around him/her. The film was made towards the end of 1941, apparently a year of great success for the Gestapo and its intelligence services, supported by anonymous tips and informants. As one of the characters observes within the film, the actions of Le corbeau, an informant, undermine perceptions of right and wrong within the entire community. It is not important whether or not what Le corbeau states is true or false but that the constant barrage of invective means everyone will suspect everyone else. Given the chance, any person would rifle through the papers and belongings of another to check for incriminating evidence. Truth itself is destroyed amidst mass social fallout.</p>\n\n	<p>This social fallout could be seen to further add fuel to the fire of claims that Clouzot was a misanthrope. Then again, while it is filled with broken people and unsavoury activities, <em>Le corbeau</em> also never seeks to assault one group over another. It is somewhat entertaining to think that details such as abortion, drug abuse and illicit sex could be brought to the fore under Nazi occupation while Hollywood’s Hays Code prevented such overt displays in the Land of the Free. Cinematic freedom always seems to be defined by how far some have been willing to push.</p>\n\n	<p>I do wonder if perhaps the film’s release was secured by how attentive Clouzot is to plot for the majority of the film. Thematically this film shares more than a passing resemblance to something like Michael Haneke’s <em>Caché</em>. However, while that later film could dabble in more general terms to evoke a spirit of guilt in France’s colonial past (among other things), Clouzot stays absolutely on point throughout, always pursuing the central narrative. This attention to story, to ensure that the film can be read as totally self-contained, may well have been what saved it. The parallels to Gestapo policy, Nazi occupation and so on may seem crystal clear to us now, but the film certainly does allow for the argument that it was all just a thriller about a demented letter-writer.</p>\n\n	<p><em>Le corbeau</em> was a huge success in France even while it was roundly blasted by both the political left and right. The conservative elements in France felt the film portrayed the nation badly and they’re undoubtedly correct. Clouzot’s film shows a group of people torn apart by suspicion and prejudice. For a nation being oppressed by a foreign power the thought of a fellow countryman making a film that depicted France thusly was unthinkable. Even after the war it took France many years to come to terms with its complicity in Nazi war actions. In addition, the film repeatedly makes motions to dismiss the authority of the church and portrays the various politicians within the story as weak-kneed opportunists. Meanwhile, for the Communists and the resistance movement on the other side many of the same complaints were being made. Clouzot’s film earned him a lifetime ban from filmmaking upon the liberation of France and the subsequent ‘purification’ of the ranks. Unspoken, and no doubt due to the support of many major figures in French society (Jean-Paul Sartre and Jean Cocteau among many others), that lifetime ban was reduced to two years. Good news for film fans the world over who otherwise would not have been able to revel in <em>Le salaire de la peur</em> (<em>The Wages of Fear</em>) or <em>Les diaboliques</em>.</p>\n\n	<p>Visually the film again reinforces Clouzot’s obvious skill behind the camera. Coming in the wake of Poetic Realism the film does possess that sense of atmospheric foreboding and oppression that would later become a part of the film noir movement; a term coined by French critics for the influx of gritty American crime dramas that came with their liberation. Stark contrasts shape the black and white cinematography throughout the film with the final shot, a vengeful old woman in black walking down a small alley, providing a particularly strong visual impact. That it manages this without the guise of night-time only adds to matters. Meanwhile the number of central characters, the effortless fluidity of the story and the sustained dread of the proceedings all surely helped exonerate Clouzot when the liberation of France rolled around. Comparisons to Zola and Maupassant seem ideal and, regardless of what institutes allowed him to work, the final product is undoubtedly the singular work of an assured artist.</p>\n\n	<p>In terms of popular success I suppose Clouzot is better known for his two major works made a decade or so later. <em>Le salaire de la peur</em> is a dark and endlessly involving adventure yarn while <em>Les diaboliques</em> is a vicious and twisted thriller that not only directly inspired Hitchcock’s <em>Psycho</em> but also surely paved the way for the modern genre of ‘thriller’ as we know it. It’s most interesting then, and most gratifying, to find out that Clouzot’s talents found root much earlier and arguably with even more fervour in <em>Le corbeau</em>. It’s a potent film, charged as much by the peculiarities of its production as by the obvious skill of its director. In the turmoil of Nazi occupation many great films were still made but few could claim so much political charge as this one. The only other film that I can think of that compares is Dreyer’s masterful <em>Vredens dag</em> (<em>Day of Wrath</em>).</p>\n\n	<p id="fn16070200624d67f0e691cac" class="footnote"><sup>1</sup> Interestingly, the original script for <em>Le corbeau</em> was written before the German occupation of France.</p>', 'Le corbeau', '', 'trash', 'open', 'open', '', 'le-corbeau', '', '', '2014-08-17 17:01:19', '2014-08-17 17:01:19', '', 0, 'http://www.cinelogue.com/reviews/le-corbeau', 0, 'post', '', 0),
(151, 1, '2010-06-27 06:37:00', '2010-06-27 06:37:00', '	<p>Perhaps reminiscent of the film itself, I experienced a bout of metareality (or a coincidence if you will) while scanning the filmography of director James Marsh before embarking on this review. Just a few days earlier I watched Marsh’s directorial debut, a short <span class="caps">BBC</span> TV documentary on the Czech surrealist animator Jan Švankmajer entitled <em>The Animator of Prague</em>. That was a basic effort, pleasant and slight, but I had no idea he was the same man connected to this documentary film. It’s strange how things can connect like that, over time and space, so neatly and appropriately.</p>\n\n	<p>To a degree that’s also the lesson in this fine piece of documentary filmmaking; a stylised depiction of certain events in Black River Falls, a small town in Wisconsin, between the years 1890 and 1900. The details come from the writings of local newspaper and are coupled with photos taken during the era which twin with each other for an often startling effect. Originally a book by Michael Lesy, Marsh simply adapts the already proven formula to the screen adding in large amounts of re-enactments to keep the images flowing over the calm narration, recounting events that are sometimes funny, sometimes tragic and very often gruesome. The film also takes some extracts from the logs of the local ‘Mendota Asylum for the Mentally Insane’ which shares some overlap with the news clippings of the time.</p>\n\n	<p>The film is divided into sections depending on season and opens with a brief summation of the main events of that season; the headlines, if you will. In turn all the events of the film are bookended by a monologue written by the newspaper editor who provided so much material for the film; a glowing report of Black River Falls as a wonderful place to live and to raise children. The stories themselves range from the bizarre to the brutal to the comic. Murder, suicide and insanity are recurring events during this period, but we also get tales of the strange customs introduced by Norwegian settlers, the ongoing tales of ‘Mary Sweeney the window breaker,’ the outcries of the Women’s Temperance League and so on and so forth. Many of the events are re-enacted, in part, by actors shot in black and white. Coupled with the news copy style narration and the period photos used to complement them the newly shot footage lends an unusual and effective edge. The actors never speak, silently playing their parts, while their performances are often recycled, edited in and out of other parts of the film lending a strong sense of connectivity between the various parts and the whole. The accompanying music, largely classical, provides an appropriately lyrical and spacey tone as the visuals unfold. As a final structural element each season closes with colour footage from the modern day Black River Falls, unifying past and present.</p>\n\n	<p>The film opens up a couple of interesting questions about both documentary filmmaking and news reportage alongside its core observations concerning our own perception of society as time goes on. Obviously documentary footage is not something to be found for these events; so much of these factual descriptions are instead lent reality by performance. This brings us back to that old chestnut of documentary filmmaking that’s been around ever since Robert J. Flaherty decided smoking in the editing room was a good idea and ended up incinerating half of what was supposed to be his key non-fiction film, <em>Nanook of the North</em>. Flaherty went back to Nanook<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn4363854804d0536af8fe25">1</a></sup> and got him to restage much of what had already been shot; what was life before now had to be restaged. Nonetheless, <em>Nanook</em> is understood to be an important film in the documentary field and is often cited as the first documentary ever made. Re-enactment has become commonplace from Flaherty’s early efforts to Marsh’s film to Michael Moore’s attempts to secure a gun through opening a bank account in <em>Bowling for Columbine</em>.</p>\n\n	<p>The idea of legitimising re-enactment twins with another interesting question this film raises: the idea of a newspaper of record. The newspaper from which the stories derive is noted as being the paper of record for the area but, of course, verification is quite difficult given the time that’s gone by. The paper’s credentials are never really called into question and this is an obstacle that all historians must grapple with; just who is recording history and what perspective did they knowingly or unknowingly bring to the task? Of course the seeming preponderance on the bizarre in Black River Falls is no doubt as much a result of condensing nine or so years of news into 76 minutes as anything else.</p>\n\n	<p>Like any good newshound Marsh, and Lesy before him, chose the juiciest stories where possible. Still, the presence of these stories at all feed into what I’d take as the essence of this exercise, that is the twinning of past and present to provide a clearer perspective of both. The old bromide, recapitulated from time immemorial, proclaiming the contemporary age to be flawed or corrupted compared to the ‘good old days’ that came before seems almost a basic tenet of our conception of society; things were better when we were kids. <em>Wisconsin Death Trip</em> seeks to offer some counterbalance to that.</p>\n\n	<p>Between the years of concern we have insidious crimes&#8212;murder and vandalism&#8212;and the bizarre&#8212;sexual trysts, moral outrages, ghosts and more&#8212;all recorded by the local paper. There&#8217;s the yarn about a young thirteen year old boy who shot and murdered a man and then went on the run, shooting another man in his bid to escape. There were tales of poverty, suicide pacts and drunkenness. There were all the stories that garishly fill our papers today that elicit so much distress and lamentations for the downfall of society. Marsh’s film tells us that if this is a sickness and not just a tendency of people when grouped together then it’s been with us a lot longer than many would like to admit.</p>\n\n	<p>In the end, through the footage of the modern day Black River Falls, a sleepy little hamlet of 3,300 or so people, we see how unusual the history of any and all places must be. Because this seemingly quiet little place rests on the site of so much violence and mayhem we are given the suggestion that most other small towns are seated in much the same way. <em>Wisconsin Death Trip</em> is an unusual and interesting attempt to breathe life in to the historical record, allowing it to momentarily function the way contemporary news does now. In so doing we can compare the two, realising that the slippery moral slope of modernity is perhaps not quite as steep or as far falling as we imagined. It’s difficult to tell if it’s the people or the news media that has changed or if both are basically the same as ever but a certain sense of sentimentality and nostalgia prevents us from recognising it. That’s the discourse this little film opens up for us and it’s to be welcomed.</p>\n\n	<p id="fn4363854804d0536af8fe25" class="footnote"><sup>1</sup> In an added twist Nanook wasn&#8217;t even the native’s real name.</p>', 'Wisconsin Death Trip', '', 'trash', 'open', 'open', '', 'wisconsin-death-trip', '', '', '2014-08-17 17:00:37', '2014-08-17 17:00:37', '', 0, 'http://www.cinelogue.com/reviews/wisconsin-death-trip', 0, 'post', '', 0);

It&#8217;s established right away in a few scenes that juxtapose his daily routine of driving around the outskirts of Chicago, finding grub and buying cigarettes with grisly post-homicide tableaux of his victims in their final twisted repose. Over these tableaux we hear a throbbing synth score, as well as sound-collage mixes of each victim screaming and squirming in the grip of death. The details are intimated but withheld from full view; the director forbears here, in the beginning, dangling the gristle before us so that later on he might contextualize it into something truly dramatic and terrifying. This montage comes to a close with Henry picking up a guitar-toting hitchhiker. The next scene has Henry bringing his roommate Otis (Tom Towles) a guitar he &#8216;found&#8217; and getting acquainted with Otis&#8217; voluptuous sister Becky (Tracy Arnold). The sexual tension between the three is thick, particularly between Henry and Becky, and it will play an integral part in the rest of the drama.</p>\n\n	<p><em>Henry</em> has a unique history. It was released in 1986, looks as if it were made in the late &#8217;70s and did not find an audience until the &#8217;90s. On its first theatrical run in 1989 it was slapped with an &#8220;X&#8221; rating which didn&#8217;t seem to blunt its impact as it quickly turned a huge profit on its minuscule $100k budget. Upon its discovery by major critics in the U.S. and U.K., <em>Henry</em> was hailed for its chill factor and its departure from genre conventions. Some critics compared it to Cassavetes&#8217; best work. In any case, the film was timely because of the rising tide of serial killing as pop-culture phenomenon as well as it&#8217;s treatment of video culture and the implications it raises about mass-media portrayals of violence. It has to be one of the earliest forays in the horror mold into the idea of wanton violence as consumer product.</p>\n\n	<p>Indeed, what most shocked audiences then as now is the infamous home-invasion scene that has Henry and Otis watching a home-movie of their murder of an entire family. Director John McNaughton captured the rape/murder scene with utter video realism. That&#8217;s actually Michael Rooker holding the camera as Tom Towles runs his hands and tongue over the wife, and that&#8217;s Rooker who throws the camera down to grapple with the son who emerges from the front door, eventually snapping his neck&#8212;then Rooker subdues the father with a few swift kicks before remounting the camera to get a close-up of Towles tonguing the now-dead matriarch. This was all achieved in one take and impressively choreographed, but the amount of nerve it must have taken for Rooker and Towles to throw themselves into their roles like barbarians is unnerving and the reason it is so effectively morbid. The scene doesn&#8217;t end as Otis rewinds the tape to watch, in slow-motion, his initial disrobing of the wife which to him must be just as stimulating as the surging violence that follows.</p>\n\n	<p>What&#8217;s most original in <em>Henry</em> is the way it segregates itself from moral judgments about killing and violence. Some of the most brutal acts are played matter-of-factly without dramatic weight attached to them. McNaughton doesn&#8217;t indulge in the emotional tropes of a dramatic score or confessional narration or dialogue, spoken or visual, that might convey psychological scrutiny. At the same time, McNaughton plays with these conventions, and the outcomes of his verisimilitudes are usually comic, not tragic. This approach is well-served by a screenplay that proffers two illiterate killers, one of whom, Otis, is not only stupid, but full of other disgusting predilections. Otis learns of the cathartic aspect of killing, carrying out revenge fantasies against people who are innocent of the provocations that promoted his rage. The first provocation is a box in the nose from a kid whom he tries to seduce after selling him some weed. The second is Otis&#8217; aversion to buying a new television set that he himself destroyed. The third is simply boredom. Otis&#8217; wantonness makes Henry look heroic by comparison, which leads to an uncomfortable alliance with the viewer.</p>\n\n	<p>There is an early red herring in a scene of dialogue between Henry and Becky. Left alone in the house, they play cards when Becky begins asking some very personal questions. She learned from Otis that Henry was in prison for slaying his mother with a baseball bat, so she asks Henry about it and he disputes it saying he stabbed her to death, and goes on to talk about the provocations that precipitated it&#8212;that his mother was a prostitute who would make Henry watch her with clients, and sometimes make him wear a dress at the same time; that his father was a legless drunkard who didn&#8217;t give a damn about his wife or son. When Henry reaches the climax of these recollections, he punctuates them by reminding Becky that he shot his mother in cold blood, and that she deserved it. Becky notices the contradiction between stabbing and shooting and Henry demurs as if he simply misspoke. The immediate implication is that Henry either made it up or has repressed it, but it will become clear later on that Henry has simply killed so many people using so many different methods that his mother was just one of the sundry. Of course he can&#8217;t remember how the deed was done.</p>\n\n	<p>McNaughton exploits our identification with Henry to the full. His dalliance with Becky has the air of a sweet summer romance and when he rescues her from her brothers&#8217; clutches, there is a sense that Henry will flee with her and become her lover and protector. But this could never happen. At this point in the film it&#8217;s easy to forget that this is the same guy who plays mentor to Otis; he takes him to the park to film some homeless guys beating the crap out of each other, and there instructs him on how to dispose of victims and to vary his methods to keep the police off his trail; and for a finale gives him a gun to blast a perfect stranger under a dark bypass. But Henry&#8217;s behavior is revolting, his bland sense of justice is no consolation and McNaughton reminds us of this with a chilling ending.</p>', 'Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer', '', 'trash', 'open', 'open', '', 'henry-portrait-of-a-serial-killer', '', '', '2014-08-17 17:00:37', '2014-08-17 17:00:37', '', 0, 'http://www.cinelogue.com/reviews/henry-portrait-of-a-serial-killer', 0, 'post', '', 0),

The intersection of cinematographer Karl Freund with screenwriter Carl Mayer and director F.W. Murnau is a notable and propitious one; Murnau was at the height of his powers while Freund would go on to lens many more films in Germany and especially the United States. It&#8217;s debatable which of them is responsible for the film&#8217;s more unique attributes, but it&#8217;s also readily apparent that their combined talents made the work far better than the material might suggest on paper, no slight to Mayer&#8217;s dramatic skills. It&#8217;s a simple story, like any told through acting, lighting and set-design, but the reason for its success is its innovative camerawork. The story is channeled by Freund&#8217;s camera, which pans and tracks and throttles every moment of every scene.</p>\n\n	<p>The opening scene still dazzles. We begin on an open elevator descending toward a hotel lobby; the doors open and through the lobby we go, tracking toward the  luxury hotel&#8217;s great, rotating door. The lens here appears dewy as elsewhere, a quality both sensuous and dream-like. The rotating door may be the film&#8217;s most prominent motif after the porter&#8217;s coat, and the first time we see it we are taken through it like one of the hotel&#8217;s patrons to spy our hero, the porter (Emil Jannings), risking sogginess to tend to luggage in the torrential rain. Low angles establish his sense of superiority even among the affluent, and the space of the hotel is exaggerated so it appears the center of the porter&#8217;s universe. Words can&#8217;t express the power of the camera&#8217;s movements during this long scene. Depending on the account, it was either a baby-carriage or a wheelchair that dollied the camera. It simply has to be seen.</p>\n\n	<p>Coming out of the rain, the porter discards his rain jacket and now we see the source of his exuberance, his porter&#8217;s coat, a glittering gem of thread and button, the cynosure of every scene here on out. It resembles something military and attaches to its wearer prestige and rank, and accords a dignity not won by the man, for the porter is an aging cartoon, mustachioed and clownishly rotund. It becomes apparent that he&#8217;s too old for the job when he can&#8217;t lift a patron&#8217;s luggage without great difficulty. He rests on his haunches after this trying moment, the patron wags his finger at the porter&#8217;s superior and, just like that, he&#8217;s demoted, forced to trade his magic coat for the white blouse of a washroom attendant. A clever trick has the camera appear to track directly through the plate-glass window of the hotel manager&#8217;s office as the porter awaits the relinquishment of his position in the adjacent room.</p>\n\n	<p>The porter is a man who has put his soul into objects, foremost among them the pristine uniform with gleaming buttons that he worships, divesting himself of any sort of pride or exuberance that isn&#8217;t invested in the article. As a result, the loss of his position is not so much an insult to his abilities as a man or one of pecuniary concern, but it means the relinquishment of his most prized possession&#8230; into which he has transmitigated his soul. His first thought when stripped of it is not finding a better occupation or coping with its meaning to his life, but simply getting the thing back. His trek home after his demotion is another virtuosic achievement of Murnau&#8217;s when the towering hotel actually appears to fall over to crush the defeated porter. </p>\n\n	<p>Expressionistic touches such as this tell us something of his thought processes. The pathos of his agony is clear, so it&#8217;s not surprising when the porter devises to steal the coat back from the hotel. Wearing it once again, he successfully deceives his family and tenement neighbors into believing he still has his former rank; they won&#8217;t be subjected to his &#8216;nakedness&#8217; without it . But when his wife brings the porter his lunch and sees him in his pitiful garb tending the hotel bathroom, she belts out a Munchian scream into the camera as if she has just glimpsed the man in some frightful erotica.</p>\n\n	<p>When everyone in the tenement building discovers the sad truth, the porter becomes the butt of jokes; he still wears the outfit but it is a shell, a mockery, and his hunched gait only confirms it. The attitude of his neighbors toward him fulfills the fears pregnant in his dream a day before, a dream that has superimposed faces swirling about him, cackling derisively at his misfortune. There is another remarkable scene the morning after his daughter&#8217;s marital celebration. The porter, still drunk, daydreams of a triumphant return to the hotel, bedecked in splendor, lifting that nagging luggage over his head one-handed like an Adonis and flinging it in the air to the amazement of an affluent crowd. The frame is blurred, the camera tilted, and Freund tracks along with the porter through the hotel doors and among the crowd. It has all the surreality and authenticity of a dream, the camera movement and the lighting again are exceptional, especially considering the long length of the take.</p>\n\n	<p><em>Der letzte Mann</em> was the culmination of a series of so-called &#8220;instinct films&#8221;, of which Carl Mayer played a key role, a small generation of German silent films in the early &#8217;20s which similarly attempt a more direct visual conveyance of feelings, or <em>psychological drama</em>, and, according to German film historian Siegfried Kracauer, have the same thematic preoccupations: &#8220;they are laid in a lower middle-class world which is the meaningless remnant of a disintegrated society.&#8221;<sup id="fnrev3867429374d40650fbb12d" class="footnote"><a href="#fn3867429374d40650fbb12d">1</a></sup> I&#8217;m not sure what he means by &#8216;meaningless&#8217;, but aren&#8217;t the Germans harsh in their diction?</p>\n\n	<p>The entire film, with one exception, is without intertitles; the exception being an apology by the film&#8217;s authors for the epilogue to follow. The film ends ostensibly with the porter in utter turmoil, withering away in the hotel washroom, but the studio demanded a happier ending. So Mayer and Murnau obliged with a cynical epilogue that has the porter inheriting a vast fortune from a hotel patron who died in his arms; the porter proceeds to dine at the hotel in opulence, stuffing himself, smoking cigars and mocking his former nemeses. It&#8217;s not without its charms, and rather amusing today, but it can easily be cast off to enjoy the film&#8217;s more singular pleasures.</p>\n\n	<p id="fn3867429374d40650fbb12d" class="footnote"><sup>1</sup> Kracauer, Siegfried. <em>From Caligari to Hitler: A Psychological History of the German Film</em>, pg. 96.</p>', 'The Last Laugh', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '133-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-08-17 17:00:37', '2014-08-17 17:00:37', '', 133, 'http://localhost/NewGravel/133-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

It&#8217;s established right away in a few scenes that juxtapose his daily routine of driving around the outskirts of Chicago, finding grub and buying cigarettes with grisly post-homicide tableaux of his victims in their final twisted repose. Over these tableaux we hear a throbbing synth score, as well as sound-collage mixes of each victim screaming and squirming in the grip of death. The details are intimated but withheld from full view; the director forbears here, in the beginning, dangling the gristle before us so that later on he might contextualize it into something truly dramatic and terrifying. This montage comes to a close with Henry picking up a guitar-toting hitchhiker. The next scene has Henry bringing his roommate Otis (Tom Towles) a guitar he &#8216;found&#8217; and getting acquainted with Otis&#8217; voluptuous sister Becky (Tracy Arnold). The sexual tension between the three is thick, particularly between Henry and Becky, and it will play an integral part in the rest of the drama.</p>\n\n	<p><em>Henry</em> has a unique history. It was released in 1986, looks as if it were made in the late &#8217;70s and did not find an audience until the &#8217;90s. On its first theatrical run in 1989 it was slapped with an &#8220;X&#8221; rating which didn&#8217;t seem to blunt its impact as it quickly turned a huge profit on its minuscule $100k budget. Upon its discovery by major critics in the U.S. and U.K., <em>Henry</em> was hailed for its chill factor and its departure from genre conventions. Some critics compared it to Cassavetes&#8217; best work. In any case, the film was timely because of the rising tide of serial killing as pop-culture phenomenon as well as it&#8217;s treatment of video culture and the implications it raises about mass-media portrayals of violence. It has to be one of the earliest forays in the horror mold into the idea of wanton violence as consumer product.</p>\n\n	<p>Indeed, what most shocked audiences then as now is the infamous home-invasion scene that has Henry and Otis watching a home-movie of their murder of an entire family. Director John McNaughton captured the rape/murder scene with utter video realism. That&#8217;s actually Michael Rooker holding the camera as Tom Towles runs his hands and tongue over the wife, and that&#8217;s Rooker who throws the camera down to grapple with the son who emerges from the front door, eventually snapping his neck&#8212;then Rooker subdues the father with a few swift kicks before remounting the camera to get a close-up of Towles tonguing the now-dead matriarch. This was all achieved in one take and impressively choreographed, but the amount of nerve it must have taken for Rooker and Towles to throw themselves into their roles like barbarians is unnerving and the reason it is so effectively morbid. The scene doesn&#8217;t end as Otis rewinds the tape to watch, in slow-motion, his initial disrobing of the wife which to him must be just as stimulating as the surging violence that follows.</p>\n\n	<p>What&#8217;s most original in <em>Henry</em> is the way it segregates itself from moral judgments about killing and violence. Some of the most brutal acts are played matter-of-factly without dramatic weight attached to them. McNaughton doesn&#8217;t indulge in the emotional tropes of a dramatic score or confessional narration or dialogue, spoken or visual, that might convey psychological scrutiny. At the same time, McNaughton plays with these conventions, and the outcomes of his verisimilitudes are usually comic, not tragic. This approach is well-served by a screenplay that proffers two illiterate killers, one of whom, Otis, is not only stupid, but full of other disgusting predilections. Otis learns of the cathartic aspect of killing, carrying out revenge fantasies against people who are innocent of the provocations that promoted his rage. The first provocation is a box in the nose from a kid whom he tries to seduce after selling him some weed. The second is Otis&#8217; aversion to buying a new television set that he himself destroyed. The third is simply boredom. Otis&#8217; wantonness makes Henry look heroic by comparison, which leads to an uncomfortable alliance with the viewer.</p>\n\n	<p>There is an early red herring in a scene of dialogue between Henry and Becky. Left alone in the house, they play cards when Becky begins asking some very personal questions. She learned from Otis that Henry was in prison for slaying his mother with a baseball bat, so she asks Henry about it and he disputes it saying he stabbed her to death, and goes on to talk about the provocations that precipitated it&#8212;that his mother was a prostitute who would make Henry watch her with clients, and sometimes make him wear a dress at the same time; that his father was a legless drunkard who didn&#8217;t give a damn about his wife or son. When Henry reaches the climax of these recollections, he punctuates them by reminding Becky that he shot his mother in cold blood, and that she deserved it. Becky notices the contradiction between stabbing and shooting and Henry demurs as if he simply misspoke. The immediate implication is that Henry either made it up or has repressed it, but it will become clear later on that Henry has simply killed so many people using so many different methods that his mother was just one of the sundry. Of course he can&#8217;t remember how the deed was done.</p>\n\n	<p>McNaughton exploits our identification with Henry to the full. His dalliance with Becky has the air of a sweet summer romance and when he rescues her from her brothers&#8217; clutches, there is a sense that Henry will flee with her and become her lover and protector. But this could never happen. At this point in the film it&#8217;s easy to forget that this is the same guy who plays mentor to Otis; he takes him to the park to film some homeless guys beating the crap out of each other, and there instructs him on how to dispose of victims and to vary his methods to keep the police off his trail; and for a finale gives him a gun to blast a perfect stranger under a dark bypass. But Henry&#8217;s behavior is revolting, his bland sense of justice is no consolation and McNaughton reminds us of this with a chilling ending.</p>', 'Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '153-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-08-17 17:00:37', '2014-08-17 17:00:37', '', 153, 'http://localhost/NewGravel/153-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Along with screenwriter Shinobu Hashimoto, who would write consistently with other great directors including Kurosawa, Kobayashi unwaveringly questions the traditions, the prevalent myths of his country. Not only the martial, authoritarian state of Japan but, indeed, all systems of hierarchy are implicated in his polemics. <em>Harakiri</em>, just as his epic nine-hour trilogy <em>The Human Condition</em>, exploring the wartime conditions of soldiers and their relationship to their commanders, focuses on the martial state. Here his indictment strikes at the very heart of it by choosing as setting Edo in the year 1630, very shortly before the Tokugawa regime establishes itself. This is the beginning of the samurai as we know the institution, and also a time of &#8220;relative&#8221; peace.</p>\n\n	<p>This setting also hints at the anti-samurai, anti-chambara essence of the film, which will become more and more clear upon examination.

(475, 1, '2014-08-17 17:00:37', '2014-08-17 17:00:37', '	<p>For the final installment of our prison feature we bring you the first film from Australian filmmaker John Hillcoat, who would years later go on to achieve some recognition for the elegiac western <em>The Proposition</em> and, more recently <em>The Road</em>, an adaptation of Cormac McCarthy&#8217;s despairing, post-apocalyptic novel of the same title. As in those films, he works with Australian punk idol and balladeer Nick Cave, who co-wrote and composed the score for <em>Ghosts&#8230; of the Civil Dead</em>, penned <em>The Proposition</em> and provided the score and also scored <em>The Road</em>. And like <em>The Road</em> this film too is futuristic, making it unique among our selection of prison films. A title sequence from the prison log files establishes setting: a remote facility located somewhere in the feral deserts of Australia. We are told it houses the most deranged and dangerous convicts in the country.</p>\n\n	<p>We are introduced to a seemingly docile bloke by the name of Wenzil (David Field in what is clearly his first role), who, probably to the films detriment, quickly becomes the focus—Hillcoat will smartly shift focus away from him shortly to the individual inmates. He undergoes the standard initiation: sheared, shaved, dressed and thrown in to the lockup. He intuits that it’s best to keep his mouth shut in this place and as a result speaks very little throughout. Wenzil is brought up to speed by a chain-smoking veteran, a guy who seems to shepherd virgin inmates, advising him to “watch your back in here. Oy! Watch your back I said.”</p>\n\n	<p>The game rules of the prison established, <em>Ghosts&#8230; of the Civil Dead</em> largely lurches forward; its plot is loose (inconsequential really) and for a long time a string of surly vignettes provides the meager and much needed momentum. There&#8217;s no cohesive narrative, at least in the first act, to make it compelling. Hillcoat simply shows us the game and how it&#8217;s played, then moves from one cell soliloquy to the next, each presented as the thoughts of the various inmates. This device works quite well in this setting, highlighting as it does the alienation and forlornness (and in some cases balefulness) of its denizens. It also means character development without needless dialogue, something accomplished further with consistently placed prison journal entries describing some events too expensive for this shoot.</p>\n\n	<p>Through these vignettes, however, a plot <em>does</em> eventually emerge. By halfway the screws become suspect. They seem to be provoking the inmates to violence through various means. It begins with the confiscation and destruction of personal property (including a drug raid), profligate cavity searches and eventually taking their television sets as well. We are shown a table shot of various drugs and every manner of smoking and injecting device: various needles, pipes, lighters, spoons, etc. The digital log informs us that a man was brutally murdered (stabbed 72 times) in the outdoor recreation yards by two men&#8230; with the rumor that the administration gave orders for an aboriginal (black) to rec with two known black killers. They bring in psychos from another cellblock, including a cackling, obscenity spewing bastard played schizophrenically by Nick Cave (in a way the role is a perfectly logical extension of his stage persona with the Birthday Party and others). “Kill me! Kill me! Kill me! Come in here and fuckin&#8217; try to kill me!” he screams from his cell, the director framing him against a wall with a smeared blood caricature of a penetrated woman behind his head.</p>\n\n	<p>One inmate even scolds the administration from the newly constructed indoor recreation area (read: chain-link cage) accusing them of intentionally inducing psychosis which makes one “become predatory&#8230; compulsive!&#8221; He continues, saying:</p>\n\n	<blockquote>\n		<p>&#8220;Do you know what you&#8217;re doin here? Do ya? You are creating a lot of angry men is what you&#8217;re doing. And one day those men are gonna go out there&#8230; and that day those people, out there, are gonna pay for what you are doing in here. You remember that!”</p>\n	</blockquote>\n\n	<p>It&#8217;s uneven but also disturbing, violent and visceral cinema. From Lilly, a long-haired man with a feminine frame who copes with prison life by assuming the role of a cross-dressing prostitute; to the clever system of note passing (attaching a folded note to one end of a string and finger flicking it under the cell door using centrifugal force to swing it to the adjacent cell); to the profligate use of heroin, the crude tattooing guns, the brutal beatings over territory and theft. In hindsight, though it may be a necessary bromide of the genre, it was wise of Hillcoat to establish the prison economy early (cigarettes, tattoos and sex being the most marketable commodities) for it is largely the deprivation of these luxuries that bears responsibility for driving the prisoners to desperation (and the plot forward).</p>\n\n	<blockquote>\n		<p>“October staff reports indicate that 11 inmates required medical attention due to acts of self mutilation. Upwards of 30 inmates commenced hunger strikes and that several fires were lit within the prison.” &#8211; Prison log</p>\n	</blockquote>\n\n	<p>It&#8217;s a very (at least seemingly) nihilistic portrait, a microcosm of a dystopian society. We are guided through, witness the deterioration of order and sanity culminating in a brutal murder&#8230; and then it&#8217;s forgotten. The conspiracy among the head screws and whoever else above them has apparently succeeded, the result of which is that the prison is to be destroyed and replaced with a much larger (and more expensive) one and five men are released (for no particular reason, or at least not perceived by me), including the lead. He returns to the &#8220;civilized&#8221; world, remarking mysteriously: &#8220;One man released so they can imprison the rest of the world.&#8221;</p>\n\n	<p>All in all, <em>Ghosts… of the Civil Dead</em> is untempered but it&#8217;s also audacious and eminently disturbing. With the filmmakers wanting for the purse they nevertheless crafted a gritty, brutally realistic portrait given what they had to work with. Aside wanting for a more compelling narrative this film falls short technically as well; the digital log readouts a banal attempt to transport us to the future for one. It doesn’t work, and the surprisingly bright, incongruous, Technicolor-like environs come off as shabby and hackneyed. Despite its numerous flaws, and the difficulty in viewing at times, it’s still somehow realistic and engaging (thanks largely I&#8217;m sure to its clever subtleties and the intimate plumbing of convicted minds) and rather remarkable for a first time director. Hillcoat would bide his time and wait 8 years before attempting another feature, and then 9 more after that. It would pay off in <em>The Proposition</em>, a far more technically polished and engrossing, but equally honest examination of violence in society.</p>', 'Ghosts... of the Civil Dead', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '149-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-08-17 17:00:37', '2014-08-17 17:00:37', '', 149, 'http://localhost/NewGravel/149-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Just a few days earlier I watched Marsh’s directorial debut, a short <span class="caps">BBC</span> TV documentary on the Czech surrealist animator Jan Švankmajer entitled <em>The Animator of Prague</em>. That was a basic effort, pleasant and slight, but I had no idea he was the same man connected to this documentary film. It’s strange how things can connect like that, over time and space, so neatly and appropriately.</p>\n\n	<p>To a degree that’s also the lesson in this fine piece of documentary filmmaking; a stylised depiction of certain events in Black River Falls, a small town in Wisconsin, between the years 1890 and 1900. The details come from the writings of local newspaper and are coupled with photos taken during the era which twin with each other for an often startling effect. Originally a book by Michael Lesy, Marsh simply adapts the already proven formula to the screen adding in large amounts of re-enactments to keep the images flowing over the calm narration, recounting events that are sometimes funny, sometimes tragic and very often gruesome. The film also takes some extracts from the logs of the local ‘Mendota Asylum for the Mentally Insane’ which shares some overlap with the news clippings of the time.</p>\n\n	<p>The film is divided into sections depending on season and opens with a brief summation of the main events of that season; the headlines, if you will. In turn all the events of the film are bookended by a monologue written by the newspaper editor who provided so much material for the film; a glowing report of Black River Falls as a wonderful place to live and to raise children. The stories themselves range from the bizarre to the brutal to the comic. Murder, suicide and insanity are recurring events during this period, but we also get tales of the strange customs introduced by Norwegian settlers, the ongoing tales of ‘Mary Sweeney the window breaker,’ the outcries of the Women’s Temperance League and so on and so forth. Many of the events are re-enacted, in part, by actors shot in black and white. Coupled with the news copy style narration and the period photos used to complement them the newly shot footage lends an unusual and effective edge. The actors never speak, silently playing their parts, while their performances are often recycled, edited in and out of other parts of the film lending a strong sense of connectivity between the various parts and the whole. The accompanying music, largely classical, provides an appropriately lyrical and spacey tone as the visuals unfold. As a final structural element each season closes with colour footage from the modern day Black River Falls, unifying past and present.</p>\n\n	<p>The film opens up a couple of interesting questions about both documentary filmmaking and news reportage alongside its core observations concerning our own perception of society as time goes on. Obviously documentary footage is not something to be found for these events; so much of these factual descriptions are instead lent reality by performance. This brings us back to that old chestnut of documentary filmmaking that’s been around ever since Robert J. Flaherty decided smoking in the editing room was a good idea and ended up incinerating half of what was supposed to be his key non-fiction film, <em>Nanook of the North</em>. Flaherty went back to Nanook<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn4363854804d0536af8fe25">1</a></sup> and got him to restage much of what had already been shot; what was life before now had to be restaged. Nonetheless, <em>Nanook</em> is understood to be an important film in the documentary field and is often cited as the first documentary ever made. Re-enactment has become commonplace from Flaherty’s early efforts to Marsh’s film to Michael Moore’s attempts to secure a gun through opening a bank account in <em>Bowling for Columbine</em>.</p>\n\n	<p>The idea of legitimising re-enactment twins with another interesting question this film raises: the idea of a newspaper of record. The newspaper from which the stories derive is noted as being the paper of record for the area but, of course, verification is quite difficult given the time that’s gone by. The paper’s credentials are never really called into question and this is an obstacle that all historians must grapple with; just who is recording history and what perspective did they knowingly or unknowingly bring to the task? Of course the seeming preponderance on the bizarre in Black River Falls is no doubt as much a result of condensing nine or so years of news into 76 minutes as anything else.</p>\n\n	<p>Like any good newshound Marsh, and Lesy before him, chose the juiciest stories where possible. Still, the presence of these stories at all feed into what I’d take as the essence of this exercise, that is the twinning of past and present to provide a clearer perspective of both. The old bromide, recapitulated from time immemorial, proclaiming the contemporary age to be flawed or corrupted compared to the ‘good old days’ that came before seems almost a basic tenet of our conception of society; things were better when we were kids. <em>Wisconsin Death Trip</em> seeks to offer some counterbalance to that.</p>\n\n	<p>Between the years of concern we have insidious crimes&#8212;murder and vandalism&#8212;and the bizarre&#8212;sexual trysts, moral outrages, ghosts and more&#8212;all recorded by the local paper. There&#8217;s the yarn about a young thirteen year old boy who shot and murdered a man and then went on the run, shooting another man in his bid to escape. There were tales of poverty, suicide pacts and drunkenness. There were all the stories that garishly fill our papers today that elicit so much distress and lamentations for the downfall of society. Marsh’s film tells us that if this is a sickness and not just a tendency of people when grouped together then it’s been with us a lot longer than many would like to admit.</p>\n\n	<p>In the end, through the footage of the modern day Black River Falls, a sleepy little hamlet of 3,300 or so people, we see how unusual the history of any and all places must be. Because this seemingly quiet little place rests on the site of so much violence and mayhem we are given the suggestion that most other small towns are seated in much the same way. <em>Wisconsin Death Trip</em> is an unusual and interesting attempt to breathe life in to the historical record, allowing it to momentarily function the way contemporary news does now. In so doing we can compare the two, realising that the slippery moral slope of modernity is perhaps not quite as steep or as far falling as we imagined. It’s difficult to tell if it’s the people or the news media that has changed or if both are basically the same as ever but a certain sense of sentimentality and nostalgia prevents us from recognising it. That’s the discourse this little film opens up for us and it’s to be welcomed.</p>\n\n	<p id="fn4363854804d0536af8fe25" class="footnote"><sup>1</sup> In an added twist Nanook wasn&#8217;t even the native’s real name.</p>', 'Wisconsin Death Trip', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '151-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-08-17 17:00:37', '2014-08-17 17:00:37', '', 151, 'http://localhost/NewGravel/151-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

It&#8217;s your heart and mind.”</p>\n	</blockquote>\n\n	<p>This opening koan is accompanied by a beautiful slow-motion shot of long, grass-like tree branches floating on the wind. This image seems to represent an ideal of some sort (one open to interpretation), but regardless it&#8217;s enchanting and completely anathema to the ruin to follow. It will be recapitulated at story&#8217;s end.</p>\n\n	<p>Lee Byung-hun plays the stoic gangster Kim Sun-woo, a man on his way up in the syndicate until he makes a single, fatal mistake. This is presaged by the head of the organization who says, “You can do 100 things right but one mistake can destroy everything.” The consequences are tragic, but his error is one of compassion. The boss suspects his girlfriend of seeing another man so he charges our protagonist with keeping an eye on her while he&#8217;s away. Kim Sun-woo seems to feel insulted by the task, which is essentially babysitting this younger woman—he is after all an “enforcer” in the organization. His indifference is quickly overtaken by Hee-soo as he comes to know her: small talk passing through a museum, glances over a meal, watching her play cello in recital. When he discovers her with another man at her home, and after beating the hell out of him, he is faced with a dilemma. Instead of calling the boss immediately (who would then dispose of this boyfriend and probably Hee-soo as well) Sun-woo decides to send him away and make them promise to never see each other again. He not only risks his reputation but his very life for her sake, and inevitably the boss learns of the deception.</p>\n\n	<p>Sun-woo is a man who tends to talk only when necessary, when what he has to say is meaningful. As a result he never reveals himself explicitly. It is up to Lee Byung-hun to use body language, particularly his face, to fulfill this character (and director Kim Ji-woon to hint at it through composition). He&#8217;s also quite the insouciant character. He at once coolly embarrasses a cohort while also flippantly dismissing an important figure in the underworld. This nonchalance, which is rather typical of action movie heroes come to think of it, endears us to the character. But we&#8217;re given the suggestion that this strong reason for liking him may also be the source of his downfall. And his hubris <em>will</em> come back to him in a devastating way.</p>\n\n	<p>The image I chose for this film captures a certain mood that may only be understood after watching it, but it does not capture the essence of <em>A Bittersweet Life</em>, which at its core is a very violent film falling neatly within the gangster/crime and action genres. We see Sun-woo utilize his taekwon-do skills to pummel several men as the opening credits roll, in fact. The first act on the whole has comparatively little of this; instead it develops character, nearly verges on romance and creates a kind of atmosphere of pathos that endears us to Sun-woo and prepares us for a bloody second act (and third). Once Sun-woo&#8217;s deception is found out, however, Kim Ji-woon kicks it in to high gear as sweet longing gives way to bitter revenge fantasy.</p>\n\n	<p><em>A Bittersweet Life</em> has been accused of favoring style over substance, indulging in cliché and even borrowing from Park Chan-wook&#8217;s revenge thriller <em>Oldboy</em>. Considered threadbare the plot is nothing new and it is certainly predictable at times, but I think there&#8217;s much more happening here to largely compensate these flaws. Kim Ji-yong&#8217;s cinematography is often mesmerizing and very much imbued with a personal style. The scene of Hee-soo in recital comes to mind. She is plying her cello confidently and when her section is at rest she looks up to catch Sun-woos eyes. But she also captures ours for she is looking directly in to the camera, a smile creeping in to her face. And the explosive action sequences, in particular, are choreographed and shot in an original, even dynamic, way and the very fact of their explosiveness makes what could be a dull viewing experience a hell of a ride.</p>\n\n	<p>Sun-woo is first attacked in his home (which is set up in a very clever way that should remain a surprise), taken to a warehouse to be hung from chains, brutalized throughout; refusing to apologize to the boss he has his hand squashed with a colossal wrench and then he is buried in mud—meaning he must crawl from the deep-six with only one good hand. The boss has him nearly killed, but he gives him several chances to make amends, the last of which Sun-woo takes advantage of to escape while taking out a large group of henchmen in the process. From skull-stabbing with a cell phone battery to slamming a face in to a wall and dragging it along the brick and hijacking a car to flee this character takes the tough guy persona to another level, surviving multiple stab wounds, gun shots and more and dealing death and destruction in response. I recommend watching at least this one sequence at full volume.</p>\n\n	<p>If nothing else, fans of gangster films (or fist and gun-play in general) should appreciate this film for its inventive badassery alone. The sequences of capture, savage humiliation and escape are particularly striking: rain falls throughout, evoking a sense of urgency and hopelessness at the same time; of course it is late at night so this is the least colorful part of the film, that is until the escape scene when the frame erupts in a furious blood-soaked array of fiery reds and oranges.</p>\n\n	<p>“If the hammer is light the nail will rise back up,” the boss comments to his associates in light of Sun-woos audacious escape. At this point the gangster myths are fully illuminated and you realize that <em>A Bittersweet Life</em> all along has attempted to turn the tropes of the genre on their head. He adds, “If the boss says you&#8217;re wrong then you&#8217;re wrong&#8230; even if you didn&#8217;t really do it.” The rules of the game, codified daily in the visceral, dog-eat-dog world of organized crime are here bluntly stated as a matter of fact. Director Kim Ji-woon seems to be aiming at satire while never indulging in it, the sporadic comedy sprinkled throughout this film hurled at the entire enterprise, mocking it at a distance. But a true satire would likely only blunt the sharp edge so skillfully honed here, that is the reality of the tragedy unfolding in the most violent ways imaginable. Instead <em>A Bittersweet Life</em> embraces black comedy, deftly scripted by the director himself and something the latest generation of South Korean filmmakers continue to weave so skillfully in to their work.</p>\n\n	<p>The bossman then furnishes an anecdote of a strikingly similar incident: “That guy lost his hand. One promising guy&#8217;s life ended just like that one morning. This time one hand is not enough.” Sun-woo, resigned to his fate, sets about eliminating the organization that fostered him and has now so degraded him. He purchases weapons from a cadre of Russian (or Mongolian?) arms dealers in a hilarious encounter that simply must be seen. The penultimate action sequence to follow grants the director one more opportunity for irony: as Sun-woo aims a pistol at his former master, three words adorning the bar become visible between their figures: La Dolce Vita. It&#8217;s my guess that this is a very clever reference to Fellini&#8217;s film, a work of pomp and circumstance deriding the self-indulgent aristocracy of 1950s Italy. The intended analogy could be that the gangster lifestyle too is absurd and our romantic preoccupation with it is painfully deluded. Perhaps it&#8217;s a relic of the 20th century best left behind. If this is true we can extend the analogy to include our protagonist who, like Marcello Mastroianni in Fellini&#8217;s yarn, is searching for a more meaningful way of life, one that, due to present circumstances and the rigor of his chosen lifestyle generally, he can never realize. This interpretation lends itself to the following parable which bookends the film:</p>\n\n	<blockquote>\n		<p>“One late autumn night the disciple woke up crying, so the master asked the disciple, &#8216;Did you have a nightmare?&#8217; &#8216;No.&#8217; &#8216;Did you have a sad dream?&#8217; &#8216;No,&#8217; said the disciple. &#8216;I had a sweet dream.&#8217; &#8216;Then why are you crying so sadly?&#8217; The disciple answered quietly while wiping his tears. &#8216;Because the dream I had can&#8217;t come true.”</p>\n	</blockquote>\n\n	<p>With it&#8217;s inventive choreography, sentimentalism, intelligent scripting, strong acting, clever interpolation of gangster tropes and it&#8217;s charm, <em>A Bittersweet Life</em> is an impressive piece of filmmaking.

This is a rather simple category that leads to simplified notions of morality, Manichean in apprehension and Hebrew in aspect. Larry is a man struck by a series of mockingly ruinous events for which he has no explanation; his life has been one of reticent humility. With no apparent karmic reasonableness, then, Larry is dumbfounded by all that has befouled and befallen him. His appeals to the heavens include the protestation, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t done anything!&#8221;. Like Job his character is being tested by unseen forces, until, that is, Larry is given the opportunity to cheat. He takes the easy way out of a difficult situation and what befalls him next, at film&#8217;s end, will make his prior squalor seem like a prelude to the opening act.</p>\n\n	<p>The Job interpretation would appear to be an affirmation of Hebraic traditions—heed your elders, heed the law, heed not temptation—but it ignores the film&#8217;s most important motifs and avoids its subtleties of language, both dialogic and visual. Indeed, there are as many interpretations of the events depicted and the film holistically as there are interpretations of quantum theory. And to ignore the obvious preoccupations of the film such as causality, time and quantum uncertainty is to lose a great deal of appreciation for it. For if <em>A Serious Man</em> is nothing more than a didactic embrace of Old Testament morality, what enjoyment is there to be had from that?</p>\n\n	<p>Fortunately the Coens have given us something far from didactic, and a film not only technically competent, but rife with detail—so much so that even multiple viewings will hardly reveal all of its secrets. What we have is a modern tale, a post-Einstein, post-Freud one&#8212;not an Old Testament fable. I am sure that many reviewers will say, &#8220;this isn&#8217;t so much a film about nothingness as it is about nothing in particular&#8221;, yet nothingness <em>is</em> something, and so is perspective. This film is not pitiless, indeed it is very human. In spite of its distances, in spite of the irrationality that our protagonist faces, it is no less irrational or incomprehensible than real life often is.</p>\n\n	<p>One of the many facets tackled so consummately is the double-emphasis on communication and comprehension. Indeed we have characters attempting to either systematize, impose order upon or dissolve themselves from the responsibilities of reality. This intercourse with reality (and hence with the viewer) is best illustrated in a scene with Larry&#8217;s next-door neighbor, the alluring Mrs. Samski. She answers the door and gives Larry this thousand-yard stare that intimates sexual stimulation; her body language entire seems to intimate the same. Then she invites him inside for some tea, takes a seat next to him on the sofa and&#8230; offers him a joint. After a few hits it becomes apparent that Larry and the viewer both have perverted the situation; Mrs. Samski was simply high when she answered the door, her gleaming blue eyes were dulled by smoke, not excited by Larry. Larry&#8217;s perspective shifts considerably after his first taste of the devil weed. A police siren roaring down the street is heard by him before either Mrs. Samski or us. The audio-visual manipulations of this scene will be repeated in another memorable one when Danny attends his bar-mitzvah stoned out of his gourd.</p>\n\n	<p>There&#8217;s also a great deal to be said for the film&#8217;s ostensible synchronicities. Briefly, consider the following: the mysterious calls to Larry&#8217;s office from the Columbia Record Club—is it really his son Danny ordering records on Larry&#8217;s dime?; the confluence of letters that Larry&#8217;s supervisor receives telling him not to grant Larry a promotion&#8212;they appear to be the product of Sy&#8217;s scheming intellect, but there are other intimations; the apparent simultaneity of Larry&#8217;s minor fender bender with Sy Abelman&#8217;s, superbly rendered through parallel montage by the Coens—have we witnessed a synchronistic event or simply a &#8216;coincidental&#8217; one? The examples are numerous and there exists no final answer to their ambiguities. All that can be said for certain is that the Coens intend to breach our reality tunnels, beckoning us to take a harder look and to never take film &#8216;reality&#8217; for granted. They&#8217;re likely also having a bit of fun with the many viewers who, through imprinting or conditioning or faith, have confused causation with correlation.</p>\n\n	<p>So Larry commits a transgression against his conscience, one that harms no one save himself, but for the viewer to assume that this little transgression precipitates the terrible events that follow (or to assume this is the Coens&#8217; objective) would be a logical fallacy, a pitfall that the Coens have almost set them up for, but conviction in this kind of supernatural wrath is quite common in many belief systems. Faith, many faithful would argue, does not depend upon logic or reasonableness, but rather religious feeling, or an abandonment of reason altogether. But, and I think the Coens would agree, what is really being embraced is a rigid causality—an Aristotleian sense of time and a Euclidean sense of space. These are very old precepts, and <em>A Serious Man</em>, perhaps more than any film to date, is urging for a modern perspective, one that copes with the apparent scientific reality and abandons superstition. An uncomfortable perspective.</p>\n\n	<p>Yet it is also apparent that this film is not obsessed with trampling organized religion. Its Jewishness is pervasive and I don&#8217;t think it takes sides. Indeed, probably the sagest character in the film is the young Rabbi, who seems to understand innately that everything depends upon perspective; he possesses the kind of understated outlook one would expect from a Buddhist or a Yogi, or a disciple of Einstein. Yet this is obscured, intentionally, by the portrayal. Not only does he look rather silly but his advice—&#8220;Just look at the parking lot Larry!&#8220;—is taken by Larry (and the audience) as youthful naiveté and the scene as a result is committed to memory as humor and nothing more.</p>\n\n	<p>Speaking of which, it would be a gross dereliction to leave unmentioned the incredible humor of this film. Sy Ableman has to be one of the Coens&#8217; greatest characters, and one of the funniest in recent years. His relationship with Larry has such a genuine awkwardness and it is perfectly understated to make it all the more amusing. Remember, this is the guy who purloined his wife and, not only that, he has this soft-spoken arrogance that would make anyone&#8217;s blood boil. Sy suggests ever so benevolently that Larry move out of the house and into a motel called, ironically, &#8216;The Jolly Roger&#8217;, a dwelling Sy considers &#8220;imminently habitable&#8221;. Larry&#8217;s apparently racist neighbors are as amusing for their irrationality as any hair-triggered racist in real life and a whole host of smaller characters come and go who simultaneously add to Larry&#8217;s chagrin and make a comedy of the film&#8217;s blackness. </p>\n\n	<p id="fn5920177234d68757e99edc" class="footnote"><sup>1</sup> Stephen Vincent Benét, <em>The Innovator (A Pharaoh Speaks)</em></p>', 'A Serious Man', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '139-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-08-17 17:01:19', '2014-08-17 17:01:19', '', 139, 'http://localhost/NewGravel/139-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
(481, 1, '2014-08-17 17:01:19', '2014-08-17 17:01:19', '	<p>There are certainly many remarkable things about Henri-Georges Clouzot’s <em>Le corbeau</em>. Only the man’s second feature as a solo director the film emerges fully formed and expertly polished with all the control of a seasoned veteran. A decade or so of experience as a scriptwriter obviously served him well. Alongside that it is dark, vicious and seething with all manner of social ills all while being made in a France that languished under the control of the Nazis. Occupation or no, seemingly the most remarkable thing about Clouzot’s film is that it managed to be made at all.</p>\n\n	<p>Under the Nazi regime all French cinema had to be submitted for approval to a board made up of ranking members of Vichy society; usually army generals, priests, politicians and other social figureheads. Such a board as this would have quickly caught Clouzot’s remarkably dark tale of a small French village that turns upon itself under a wave of poison-pen letters. However, this film came into being under the auspices of Continental-Films, a German production company. Continental-Films had basically been founded by the Nazi party and was headed up by Alfred Greven with the specific goal, set by Goebbels himself, of producing light and purely entertaining films to distract the French masses from their plight as an occupied nation. Greven agreed to the mission statement but had ideas of his own. It would seem that while he wished to comply with Goebbels’ request he did recognise a duty and an opportunity to make great cinema. So it was that Greven strove for and maintained standards that led to the production of numerous quality films even if they did not stir the French people to rise against (apparently one such film he supervised did suggest national pride and Goebbel’s quickly banned it even while citing it as a magnificent production). So, with a Continental-Films production logo, Clouzot’s film escaped the hurdle of a meddling Vichy regime.</p>\n\n	<p>The film’s story is actually based on a real life incident that occurred in Tulle, France in the 1920s. In that town a series of poison-pen letters, anonymous messages that revealed hidden information and gossip to all and sundry, sent shockwaves through society and threatened social order<sup id="fnrev16070200624d67f0e691cac" class="footnote"><a href="#fn16070200624d67f0e691cac">1</a></sup>. In Clouzot’s hands the film takes on all kinds of different shades. Set in an unnamed provincial village the setting suggests a detachment from the rest of the world that makes this society nowhere and everywhere. Everyone knows everyone else and so, when illicit details come to be revealed, the fallout is considerable. Such is Clouzot’s expert touch that the film effortlessly supports a large central cast. Chief among them is the doctor Rémy Germain, played by Continental-Film’s biggest star Pierre Fresnay. Alongside him we have psychiatrists, nurses, lovers, seductresses, townsfolk both young and old and Le corbeau (The Raven) him/herself, the cause of all this trouble. Germain has gained something of a reputation as an abortionist after a few difficult deliveries led him to choose the life of the mother over the child. Meanwhile, morphine has gone missing from the hospital’s supply room and money from the post office’s till. Le corbeau seems to see and know all and reveals it through hundreds of letters sent to all within the village. The result is a town torn apart by infighting, suspicion, hatred and greed.</p>\n\n	<p>Moving away from revealing any specifics of the plot, which plays out like a tense detective piece, it is still amazing that Clouzot’s film managed to be completed and released. It may have stepped over the barrier of Vichy censorship but Greven’s willingness to display this film, even if he did fire Clouzot after its completion, does speak to a love of great cinema that obviously runs contrary to the edict of the Nazi Party. The central moral dilemma is that Le corbeau is often telling the truth, even while it damages all around him/her. The film was made towards the end of 1941, apparently a year of great success for the Gestapo and its intelligence services, supported by anonymous tips and informants. As one of the characters observes within the film, the actions of Le corbeau, an informant, undermine perceptions of right and wrong within the entire community. It is not important whether or not what Le corbeau states is true or false but that the constant barrage of invective means everyone will suspect everyone else. Given the chance, any person would rifle through the papers and belongings of another to check for incriminating evidence. Truth itself is destroyed amidst mass social fallout.</p>\n\n	<p>This social fallout could be seen to further add fuel to the fire of claims that Clouzot was a misanthrope. Then again, while it is filled with broken people and unsavoury activities, <em>Le corbeau</em> also never seeks to assault one group over another. It is somewhat entertaining to think that details such as abortion, drug abuse and illicit sex could be brought to the fore under Nazi occupation while Hollywood’s Hays Code prevented such overt displays in the Land of the Free. Cinematic freedom always seems to be defined by how far some have been willing to push.</p>\n\n	<p>I do wonder if perhaps the film’s release was secured by how attentive Clouzot is to plot for the majority of the film. Thematically this film shares more than a passing resemblance to something like Michael Haneke’s <em>Caché</em>. However, while that later film could dabble in more general terms to evoke a spirit of guilt in France’s colonial past (among other things), Clouzot stays absolutely on point throughout, always pursuing the central narrative. This attention to story, to ensure that the film can be read as totally self-contained, may well have been what saved it. The parallels to Gestapo policy, Nazi occupation and so on may seem crystal clear to us now, but the film certainly does allow for the argument that it was all just a thriller about a demented letter-writer.</p>\n\n	<p><em>Le corbeau</em> was a huge success in France even while it was roundly blasted by both the political left and right. The conservative elements in France felt the film portrayed the nation badly and they’re undoubtedly correct. Clouzot’s film shows a group of people torn apart by suspicion and prejudice. For a nation being oppressed by a foreign power the thought of a fellow countryman making a film that depicted France thusly was unthinkable. Even after the war it took France many years to come to terms with its complicity in Nazi war actions. In addition, the film repeatedly makes motions to dismiss the authority of the church and portrays the various politicians within the story as weak-kneed opportunists. Meanwhile, for the Communists and the resistance movement on the other side many of the same complaints were being made. Clouzot’s film earned him a lifetime ban from filmmaking upon the liberation of France and the subsequent ‘purification’ of the ranks. Unspoken, and no doubt due to the support of many major figures in French society (Jean-Paul Sartre and Jean Cocteau among many others), that lifetime ban was reduced to two years. Good news for film fans the world over who otherwise would not have been able to revel in <em>Le salaire de la peur</em> (<em>The Wages of Fear</em>) or <em>Les diaboliques</em>.</p>\n\n	<p>Visually the film again reinforces Clouzot’s obvious skill behind the camera. Coming in the wake of Poetic Realism the film does possess that sense of atmospheric foreboding and oppression that would later become a part of the film noir movement; a term coined by French critics for the influx of gritty American crime dramas that came with their liberation. Stark contrasts shape the black and white cinematography throughout the film with the final shot, a vengeful old woman in black walking down a small alley, providing a particularly strong visual impact. That it manages this without the guise of night-time only adds to matters. Meanwhile the number of central characters, the effortless fluidity of the story and the sustained dread of the proceedings all surely helped exonerate Clouzot when the liberation of France rolled around. Comparisons to Zola and Maupassant seem ideal and, regardless of what institutes allowed him to work, the final product is undoubtedly the singular work of an assured artist.</p>\n\n	<p>In terms of popular success I suppose Clouzot is better known for his two major works made a decade or so later. <em>Le salaire de la peur</em> is a dark and endlessly involving adventure yarn while <em>Les diaboliques</em> is a vicious and twisted thriller that not only directly inspired Hitchcock’s <em>Psycho</em> but also surely paved the way for the modern genre of ‘thriller’ as we know it. It’s most interesting then, and most gratifying, to find out that Clouzot’s talents found root much earlier and arguably with even more fervour in <em>Le corbeau</em>. It’s a potent film, charged as much by the peculiarities of its production as by the obvious skill of its director. In the turmoil of Nazi occupation many great films were still made but few could claim so much political charge as this one. The only other film that I can think of that compares is Dreyer’s masterful <em>Vredens dag</em> (<em>Day of Wrath</em>).</p>\n\n	<p id="fn16070200624d67f0e691cac" class="footnote"><sup>1</sup> Interestingly, the original script for <em>Le corbeau</em> was written before the German occupation of France.</p>', 'Le corbeau', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '150-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-08-17 17:01:19', '2014-08-17 17:01:19', '', 150, 'http://localhost/NewGravel/150-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

It was also little understood by the general public. But writer Roy Minton knew quite a bit about it through his own experiences with boys, his screenplay forming the basis of a film for the <span class="caps">BBC</span> which Alan Clarke was no doubt interested in for its provocative content. Dealing head-on with issues as diverse as adolescent and generational violence, homosexuality, Christianity, bureaucracy and growing-up, Minton&#8217;s work was well suited to Clarke&#8217;s sensibilities. The finished film has since carved its brutal brand of revelation on popular notions of the punitive system in the United Kingdom and elsewhere.</p>\n\n	<p>Though originally produced for television in 1977, <em>Scum</em> was banned by the <span class="caps">BBC</span> for a time before the rights lapsed and returned to producer Clive Parsons. He and director Alan Clarke assumed bigger production costs to create a theatrical version. The two are based on the same screenplay and shot with a similarly gritty naturalism; the primary change was the subtraction of a scene where Carlin (Ray Winstone in both versions) takes a missus, a lad who will serve to emancipate his libido, a wifey to his daddy. Minton lamented the subtraction, as he felt it intimated a necessary vulnerability in Carlin&#8217;s character.</p>\n\n	<p>Carlin is introduced on a drive up the countryside, hands cuffed, with two other lads; one will inevitably be a target of racist derision, the other brutalized for his sheer delicateness (a trait later deemed &#8220;subnormal&#8221; by a screw). Carlin doesn&#8217;t seem any different, except we know a little bit more of his past which includes a scuff-up with a guard in a prior borstal. Here he seems content with scraping by unnoticed, but it&#8217;s precisely his reputation that will cause the guards to sic the resident daddy, Pongo, and his cronies on him. Cornered, Carlin has no choice but to retaliate. In a brilliant unbroken steadicam scene (one that anticipates Clarke&#8217;s extensive use of it in his later films), Carlin drops a pair of snooker balls into a sock, walks up to one of Pongo&#8217;s bullies and gives him a devastating knock to the temples before getting Pongo alone in the bathroom for a once-over.</p>\n\n	<p>While Carlin is the film&#8217;s ostensible protagonist, his rise to daddy, the borstal lingo for top dog, being the film&#8217;s only upward evolution of character, in fact the screenwriter&#8217;s real delegate is Archer (Mick Ford) who also happens to be the most flippant character, yet the most fervent. Archer&#8217;s wit, intelligence and equanimity disarms his captors while opening a universe for the spectator outside of the borstal. He&#8217;s long decided to agitate the establishment as much as possible during his sentence; declaring himself a vegetarian, refusing to wear leather on his feet, refusing Sunday chapel and using every trifle of the rule book against those who are to enforce it. He is a disruptive force and a clarifier for the audience, disentangling the myths the screws have come to believe about their station as he makes sage connections between them and his fellow scrubs, between the microcosm of their collective disenfranchisement and its import on the wider world.</p>\n\n	<p>Perhaps more than any other film in our spotlight, <em>Scum</em> narrows its gaze on alienation. Brutality is a given, and we&#8217;re subjected to plenty of it, but what is imparted more powerfully is the degradation, psychological and societal, experienced by such young boys: echoes of the oft-shouted phrase &#8216;name and number&#8217; will persist long after the credits roll. And the filmmakers seek to elicit feelings such as dread through contrasts, marked contradictions between straight behavior and the society that these young men occupy. The inmates are constantly given paradoxical instructions, led to believe one minute that they will be rewarded for their conduct and the next being slapped with time in solitary confinement. They are permitted some penurious outlets such as their weekly meetings with the matron or appeals to the headmaster which are neither efficacious nor are they meant to be. It&#8217;s unsurprising then that two different boys opt for paroxysms of wrist-slashing to solve their problems.</p>\n\n	<p>When the boys fight one another, it&#8217;s the one on the receiving end of blows that goes on governor&#8217;s report, the lacerations on his face betraying his participation in a fight. This creates an incentive for retaliation among the inmates, a battle for who can get whom on report. It also nurtures an environment of deceit&#8212;along with vengeance being stridently un-Christian values&#8212;in spite of the governor&#8217;s insistence on the borstal being a Christian mission. These values extend to the screws who are part and parcel of the provocations that occur; the screws act as bale merchants, pitting one boy against another and profiting from the schemes of the most powerful among them.</p>\n\n	<p>In a memorable scene that encapsulates the film&#8217;s emphasis on ironic failures in communication, Archer&#8217;s diplomatic appeals to Mr. Duke (Bill Dean) are met with cynicism. Archer opines that &#8220;more criminal acts are imposed on prisoners than by criminals on society&#8221; which leads to a discussion of alternatives to the punitive system. Archer suggests dialogue while Mr. Duke would rather lock-up anyone convicted of a breach of civility. Archer uses those remarks as leverage to point out the parity between screw and scrub, how each is stripped of his dignity and how each would profit from that acknowledgment. Mr. Duke, appropriately mistaking this earnest statement for insolence, scorns Archer&#8217;s insinuation that he is in any way the equal of a captive adolescent.</p>\n\n	<p>Another contrast is made with Carlin. His path is a marker for the meaning of success in a world of deprivation; his triumphs depend upon assertions of authority among and over the inmates, while those same triumphs demand submission to the authorities. His progress is a vale between these two conceptual escarpments. Carlin&#8217;s navigation is successful, but success threatens to turn him into a lapdog for the gurads and create a schism between his preoccupations to power and his devotion to his fellow inmates. Enough is enough when Davis, an object of sexual assault earlier in the film, commits suicide. Carlin furnishes an insurrection that results in the annihilation of the cafeteria and untold physical damage to the institution.</p>\n\n	<p>We think this might be a turning point, we see all the lads of every wing circling a precipice of capsized tables and chairs to the mantric, choral shout of &#8220;Dead! Dead! Dead!&#8221;&#8212;then Clarke suddenly cuts to the ringleaders of the uprising being tossed like children into their cells, faces bloodied. Then we go outside, the boys standing prostrate in military lines, defeated looks on their faces, as the governor lectures them via megaphone for their insolence and asks for a moment of silence for their &#8220;departed friend&#8221;. Over silent credits we have an unsatisfactory, yet expectedly grim finale.</p>', 'Scum', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '134-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-08-17 17:01:19', '2014-08-17 17:01:19', '', 134, 'http://localhost/NewGravel/134-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

According to a 1967 public opinion poll by the ministry of justice 71% were against the abolition, 16% were in favour and 13% undecided. But you, who oppose abolition, have you ever seen an execution chamber? Have you ever seen an execution?</p>\n	</blockquote>\n\n	<p>	Marking the beginning of <em>Death by Hanging</em> with a series of handwritten (kanji) placards, Nagisa Oshima wastes no time in communicating his opinion of the death penalty. He then narrates a documentary-style tour of the execution chamber as the condemned is guided to the noose to be hanged. The lever thrown, we witness the hanging from two angles, the second a disarming repetition in slow-motion. Thus begins Nagisa Oshima&#8217;s surreal, polemical, metaphysical and  very much under-appreciated masterwork.</p>\n\n	<p>The chamber itself, steeped in religion and possessed of the kind of lived-in austerity one would expect to find in a rectory, is sheathed within a modest building that looks like it could be a retirement home and located at the terminus of a gravel path that snakes behind the prison proper. Oshima uses the very first shot for an overhead sweep of the prison grounds and its death house—then he takes us inside.</p>\n\n	<p>A physician checks the body, still hovering a foot from the ground, to find that it has survived. The officials debate the proper course of action, their training clearly insufficient for such a contingency. The representational form has now become presentational in nature; the fact of an execution gives way to fiction. They resuscitate the boy, a Korean of Japanese parents named R (Yu Do-yun), discovering that he suffers severe amnesia. He has no identity, he hasn&#8217;t even rudimentary knowledge of the world around him. Due to a legal technicality, the condemned must have cognizance of their actions to be executed; everyone takes a side. The priest, convinced that the boy before them is no longer the R who committed rape and murder (for the soul of <em>that</em> R has ascended), pleads with the officials and admonishes them for their determination to try the hanging again.</p>\n\n	<p>Only the public prosecutor is divested. His all-observing eyes symbolize us, the viewers; near the action but distant, unaffected, only responding with brief comment to direct questions. He is charged with observing the execution and there he remains as the guards first try verbal interrogation and psychological games, before transforming the chamber into Brechtian theatre; taking us back through time to probe R&#8217;s childhood, the dutiful prison workers play the parts of his parents and siblings. At this point the film comes nearer absurdist comedy as the guards transmogrify into caricatures, going to great lengths to jolt the boy&#8217;s memory so that he may be executed again.</p>\n\n	<p>One man in particular, the prison warden, played by long-time collaborator Kei Sato, takes his work far too seriously—the kind of maniac Kafka might swoon for. With R&#8217;s refusal, or inability, to acknowledge his identity, this man, now completely immersed in the fantasy he has constructed, goes so far as reenacting his crime by assaulting an innocent girl. Oshima then throws spatial and temporal continuity out the window as we move from a focus on the death penalty to our very notions of identity and reality. Apparently, only the lead screw can see this dead girl. While trying to convince his peers that there is indeed a body on the floor she suddenly sits up, alive and well and claiming to be R&#8217;s sister.</p>\n\n	<p>She has a long conversation, or perhaps lecture is more appropriate, with R (or non-R)–and with the guards as one by one they perceive her presence in the room—urging R didactically to revolutionary Korean nationalism and hissing venom at the guards and, indeed, all of Japan. This dialogue seems to transcend time and space, moving from the chamber to an obsidian lake as in a dream while provoking the viewer to confront one&#8217;s conceptions of social hierarchy and the structure of political life. Oshima, after all, had much invested in the life of Chin&#8217;u Ri, on whom the character of R is based. He was an ethnic Korean born in Japan and had been arrested, tried and executed for raping and killing a Japanese schoolgirl in 1958. A book of Ri&#8217;s letters was eventually published showing him to be, in Oshima&#8217;s words, “the most intelligent and sensitive youth produced by post-war Japan.”<sup id="fnrev17123671154dee528059798" class="footnote"><a href="#fn17123671154dee528059798">1</a></sup> To Nagisa Oshima and his team of writers Ri&#8217;s crimes could only be understood in the context of his second-class social status, which meant suffering economic and social repression simply because he was Korean.</p>\n\n	<p>This film was released in 1968, barely a decade since the murder and only two decades removed from the Japanese occupation of Korea. The director boldly uses it to raise his voice against the death penalty and the racialism practiced by the authorities, the prejudice against Koreans being systemic to Japanese society. Of course, more than 40 years on, Japan retains the practice of institutional execution (as does the United States), but relations with Korea have improved dramatically (and even the death penalty may be reaching a tipping point in the coming years).</p>\n\n	<p>This is less a genre film—and therefore unique among the films chosen for this feature—and more the work of an auteur. It doesn&#8217;t attempt to deal with the issues confronting life in prison and it seems at first a satire of the death penalty and those opposed to its abolition only. But in the course of events, graduating from documentary to absurd theatre to surrealist fantasy in ever-widening gradations, <em>Death By Hanging</em> deals with sexual politics, race, religion, identity, a metaphysical conception of self and more. And throughout, despite the profundity of the increasingly absurd parody, Oshima insists upon its reality. He never draws us directly into the comedy/tragedy, and the film&#8217;s message is all the stronger for it. Like the public prosecutor we are kept at arm&#8217;s length to observe and afterward reflect.</p>\n\n	<p>This is surreal, self-aware, provocative and daring filmmaking. And Brechtian in every sense of the word. This even extends to Oshima&#8217;s use of handwritten placards at film&#8217;s open, something the playwright often incorporated into his epic theatre. And it&#8217;s interesting that this style&#8212;which emphasizes representation to induce rational self-reflection on the drama&#8212;rather than clashing with the non-fiction, documentary form, actually enhances the film&#8217;s total effect. By juxtaposing the two, conflating them even, we are led to ask ourselves if the reality is not stranger than the fiction. Oshima, in effect, begins with the concrete, the particular (the fact of capital punishment) and progresses toward the general (i.e. surreal, metaphysical), passing through realistic, though absurd, drama along the way.

The prisoners of this film are on the same side as the prison administration; they are British soldiers deemed unsuitable for combat and sent behind the lines to be corrected. The treatment they receive by their own countrymen, by the officer-guards who are themselves in need of corrective drilling and the corrupt administrators who have quotas to fill is hypocritical, cruel and holds a mirror up to the whole war machine and its absurdities. In World War II, fighting was a perfunctory vocation. In <em>The Hill</em>, it&#8217;s all a business, a bureaucratic hill in the middle of the desert.</p>\n\n	<p>Regimental Sergeant Major Wilson (Harry Andrews) is showing a new Staff Sergeant, Williams (Ian Hendry), around the camp grounds, telling him what he expects of him as an officer and what the <span class="caps">RSM</span> is capable of, in short his accomplishments as warden. The <span class="caps">RSM</span> gazes at his hill, specially constructed for him in the middle of camp, like a pharaoh at his pyramid; it is a monument to his prowess as a disciplinarian and he makes damn sure his new Staff Sergeant respects it&#8212;and like the film&#8217;s characters, Oswald Morris&#8217; camera spends a great deal of time gazing at the thing. </p>\n\n	<p>Two scrubs march up to tell the <span class="caps">RSM</span> they have been approved to return to the front; the <span class="caps">RSM</span> salutes them and has them march double-time with kit out of the camp. When the two reach the solitude of the desert they plop down on their asses and give each other a gleeful look and a big sigh of relief. Apparently front-line combat is a welcome occupation after weeks under the thumb of the <span class="caps">RSM</span> and his screws. Five new scrubs enter the grounds, again interrupting the tour, and are summarily summarized by the <span class="caps">RSM</span>. These fresh five will be put under Williams&#8217; jurisdiction and will be made to suffer for it. </p>\n\n	<p>Lumet spends the first forty minutes of screen time on continuous action, introducing all the pertinent characters and motifs, introducing the viewer to the pitiless hill and the sisyphean tasks that have to be undertaken upon it. The viewer will be made to climb the hill with the new prisoners until every bodily fiber rejects another movement. This is boring and grueling and exhaustive viewing, but weirdly fascinating. Over the course of the initial drills we are slowly made to recognize the prejudices of Williams, who obviously doesn&#8217;t like Jacko King (Ossie Davis), the Jamaican, is repulsed by Stevens (Alfred Lynch) the wimp and Bartlett (Roy Kinnear) the sloth and intimidated by the physical stamina of McGrath (Jack Watson) and Roberts. In addition, he feels an inferiority to the <span class="caps">RSM</span> whose faculties have been rough-hewn by long experience. Williams has a drinking contest with the <span class="caps">RSM</span> which he loses and then wins all in the same night. On a different night Williams will attempt the hill himself, finding he can only make two complete reps on it before collapse.</p>\n\n	<p>The demise of Stevens is the most sincerely rendered of the various tragedies; all he wants is to see his wife, he isn&#8217;t cut out for this business&#8212;everyone knows it, and so does he. But nonetheless he&#8217;s a man, and a soldier, and none of his officers doubt that he can be reformed, or formed rather, into a disciplined fighting man. The way this film depicts his physical and mental discombobulation, his fear and trembling, his exposed nerves, is both tragic and very real. Stevens is a stand-in for every young man who wasted his fluids in that war or any, and it seems as if Lumet has opened old wounds with his character. It starts with Williams, who smells blood right away. Williams is the first of a few sadists who like nothing more than a lad they can bring under heel. Soon enough Williams has Stevens trudge up the hill wearing a field gas-mask just for his amusement. Lumet takes us with him over the hill, first-person, gas-mask over the lens, heavy breathing on the soundtrack, and we experience all the disorientation that Stevens must.</p>\n\n	<p>Roberts feels partially responsible for Stevens because he gets him in trouble during inspection, having him rub whitewash on his kit to cover up its blemishes instead of just scrubbing it clean. Roberts also has a bit of fun with him when he begins &#8216;sleep-drilling&#8217;. But his death is a clarion call for the other men, especially Roberts whose basic decency and empathy extends even to his antagonists. When the entire camp is ordered to stand at attention for hours on end, enduring the sun&#8217;s rays, waiting to be inspected, he remarks to another scrub: &#8220;We&#8217;re all doing time. Even the screws.&#8221; It&#8217;s Roberts who challenges Williams, appeals to the humanist Harris (Ian Bannen), a screw equally perturbed by the wantonness of his peers, and petitions to the diffident and ridiculous camp Commandant (Norman Bird) to render a verdict on Stevens&#8217; death that doesn&#8217;t contain the word &#8216;accidental&#8217;.</p>\n\n	<p>The narrative goes in a strange direction with Jacko, who, out of some pressing metaphysical need, throws his hands up in resignation. He suddenly deigns to wear the British uniform or follow orders. He now considers himself a civilian. The officers are caught so unawares by his behavior their sense of authority is punctured; they can&#8217;t make him go to his cell, or march, or do very much of anything, and he has the support of Harris, who allows him to see the Commandant nearly in the buff. Luckily for the viewer, Ossie Davis transitions this character with great aplomb, so you may not even care, but there is a strong dose of unreality here in a world so dispassionate and bureaucratically organized. The military veil can only be sundered by a man like Jacko.</p>\n\n	<p>Probably the film&#8217;s strongest moments after the long, initial action take place during a semi-revolt in which the prisoners are chanting &#8216;Stevens&#8217; and making a clamor in their cells. <span class="caps">RSM</span> Wilson deftly diverts a full-blown insurrection, and it&#8217;s thrilling to watch as Morris films it from wide-angles somewhat above the action. Wilson self-assuredly lets the men out of their cells and allows them to blow off steam, and when the fledgling mob ceases he begins picking them off one by one with a mixture of seriousness and complaisance, with a tenor of ambivalence. Harris is there to confront him; he disarms Wilson with humor, simultaneously cooling the prisoners&#8217; ardor, but cementing their position against the officers. As a result, a handful are cherry-picked for drilling, but Roberts and Jacko get a shot at petitioning the Commandant.</p>\n\n	<p>The film&#8217;s staying power lies in the strength of its screenplay, the cinematographic choices and the performances of its actors, but a current of repulsion, a total disregard for viewing expectations will make it a difficult film for many to endure. The film successfully abstracts its ideas into drama, but its ideological foundations are ones of tedium, absurdity and alienation, difficult themes to broach let alone drive hyperbolically to sometimes illogical conclusions. Indeed, this is a film that doesn&#8217;t entertain so much as it takes you over the top and dares you&#8212;to confront, categorize and define it.</p>', 'The Hill', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '140-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-08-17 17:01:20', '2014-08-17 17:01:20', '', 140, 'http://localhost/NewGravel/140-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

(486, 1, '2014-08-17 17:01:20', '2014-08-17 17:01:20', '	<p>Perhaps the most prototypical prison film in our spotlight, <em>Le trou</em> also happens to be one of the best of that category that favors escapes and derring-do. Director Jacques Becker developed the screenplay with the help of José Giovanni, the writer of the novel upon which it is based. Giovanni himself was an inmate once sentenced to death&#8212;the sentence was remanded to twenty years hard labor, a term during which, in 1947, he would attempt an escape with other prisoners. Giovanni&#8217;s fellow collaborator in the escape attempt, Roland Barbat (also known as Jean Keraudy), was used in Giovanni&#8217;s novel and was later cast to play the selfsame role in Becker&#8217;s film, in which he excels as the ringleader. Giovanni would go on to write <em>Le Deuxième Souffle</em>, adapted to the screen for Jean-Piere Melville&#8217;s film of the same name, and would later direct films himself.</p>\n\n	<p>Not uncommon in prison films, <em>Le Trou</em> begins on the outside with a brief, direct glimpse of the prison in its breadth among other Parisian edifices, inconspicuous save for the vertical bars of the windows. Far later in the film a climactic moment occurs that recalls it perhaps, but less attentive viewers will forget it for it will be swallowed in the film&#8217;s temporality and by its total mis-en-scene. But for now Becker takes us inside for an introduction. We quickly meet four cellmates, and a fifth, a D&#8217;Artagnan who has been forcibly moved to their cellblock due to repairs in his. The four are model inmates, tough and well-mannered, almost kind, but they don&#8217;t know if they can trust the newcomer, Claude Gaspard (Marc Michel). Much of the film will revolve around the confidence or lack of it between the four and their interloper, who seems to have his own orbit.</p>\n\n	<p>Roland (Jean Keraudy), who looks like a boxer, is the imposing veteran of the group, having made several successful escapes in the past he&#8217;s the natural choice to direct the operation. Manu (Philippe Leroy) has equal muster though less experience and is sort of a second-in-command and spiritual leader of the group. Geo (Michel Constantin) has the physicality of an athlete, but is lazy and content to follow directions. Vossellin (Raymond Meunier) goes by the nickname of Monseigneur, though his irreverence would lead one to disbelieve any religious devotion, and serves the function of cooling heads with his wit and warmth. </p>\n\n	<p>The four are like adopted brothers, and their bonds become increasingly apparent to us through their interactions with Claude. Hardly ever talking about themselves so much as each other, they introduce one another&#8217;s peculiarities and eccentricities to Claude, who, by contrast, seems to only give voice to his own feelings, telling the boys at great length about his life outside and the circumstances that have brought him to this fateful avenue. The film forces the viewer to identify with Claude for these reasons and others, namely his kindly nature so often remarked upon by the prison director (André Bervil), as well as his apparent innocence of the crime he&#8217;s accused of and his apprehension to violence. Becker is setting us up for something.</p>\n\n	<p>This is a strong cast of non-professionals and a capable crew, both obviously fully committed; the film possesses a completeness, a technical finesse on every level, and it has a pulse, but many of the film&#8217;s joys and revelations lie in the script, or are chiseled out of it by the deft hands of its editor. As one might expect from an adaptation of a true-to-life novel, there are details abound, sensorial minutiae at every glance, and in conjunction forming something in the mind of the viewer less corridor-like than arabesque. Note: if one has had the misfortune of enduring Bresson&#8217;s <em>A Man Escaped</em> and has come to some lofty conclusions about its merits, mark the contrasts:</p>\n\n	<p>Becker has us endure with the characters the tension, the noise, the physical weariness of forming the nascent hole in a single take no less than three and one-half minutes, focusing at a high angle on the boys as they take turns at the concrete floor. Shots like this one will be repeated aplenty; Becker&#8217;s almost nodding at us, letting us know time and motion still exist outside of his camera even as it&#8217;s still trained on something, though for normal purposes he could cut away, montage it into oblivion. We also watch as an officer dissects, with surgical fluidity, the care packages of the prisoners; though we get the idea immediately it&#8217;s still fascinating to watch him have a go at it, using a single non-serrated blade to excavate the carefully wrapped treats and toiletries. And then something that would seem to unconsciously jab at an earnest motif in Bresson&#8217;s film, we see the prisoners pressing against their window bars to pass along information and goods laterally, but instead of the conveniences of a courtyard with patrolling magi, the inmates have to get clever, swinging a slip-knotted rope from one cell to the next to reel in their contraband. Rather than a plot contrivance, a scene like this one gives flesh to the bone and seems to say &#8216;this is just one ingenuity among many, one way the prisoners elude their confinement&#8217;.</p>\n\n	<p>Without getting into too much of an undressing of <em>A Man Escaped</em> by comparison, it may be worth mentioning one more salient detail. Unlike that much-esteemed and better-known film, <em>Le trou</em> takes the viewer, logically, through the tall procedure of tracing the proposed escape route. In one of the film&#8217;s longest and most thrilling scenes, Roland and Manu have gone into the finished hole to explore the corridors below to find a sewer system through which to escape. Becker takes care with this scene as with others to render its temporality homogenous. Cuts are only ever employed to take us closer to the action, or further away, whatever the case may be, or to alternate the angle of viewing, but never time&#8212;we are with the two men every second of the way; the emphasis on timing is most evident when the boys later devise an hourglass to assist their work.</p>\n\n	<p>Roland and Manu slink their way through the prison&#8217;s underbelly, cutting through bars and doors, evading patrolmen, fashioning a master key with discarded materiel, lighting their way with a tincture of oil in an inkwell, walking steadfast through the shadows to their destination, the sewer. The plan is not set in stone; it unfurls like a flag and is subject to the whims of the breeze, and Roland with all his experience compasses it and makes his map accord with chance. Becker takes us on a memorable journey with them and with the others as they make their way into the sewer two by two, alternating their heft on the wall that separates them from freedom. </p>\n\n	<p>In one of the most breath-stealing climaxes I&#8217;ve ever seen, it&#8217;s Manu and Claude who first glimpse freedom, lifting a manhole to see the prison, at night, from the outside, and this time around we are looking up at only a portion of it. Having gone along for the ride, coming to know these men, it&#8217;s hard not to feel the same excitement these two feel. Claude feels compelled to give throat to his joy, wanting to take a taxi as it saunters past, while Manu stares silent as he is wont to do, thinking only of his brothers tarrying in their cell. If you&#8217;ve really invested yourself into the film, anger is the only emotion that&#8217;s relevant during the finale. Manu wants to wring Claude&#8217;s neck and so do we; there&#8217;s a righteous indignation that hovers in clouds. Never have I wanted so badly for a bunch of lifers to get away with it. In the diegesis of <em>Le Trou</em>, freedom is a taint.</p>', 'Le trou', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '143-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-08-17 17:01:20', '2014-08-17 17:01:20', '', 143, 'http://localhost/NewGravel/143-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

She stops, the camera moves in a bit closer, and then she begins to dance like a much younger woman as a drumbeat comes to life on the soundtrack. This seems at first to be some kind of introduction, and it is, but it&#8217;s also a mystery. The juxtaposition of shots to follow, which dive in to plot, give little indication and the scene is quickly forgotten as we are drawn in to the greater mystery: a murder has been committed and her son is the accused.</p>\n\n	<p>The son, Yoon Do-joon, is twenty-something, mentally incompetent (though the precise disorder goes unnamed) and completely dependent on his mother. He takes great offense to being called &#8220;retard&#8221; which he responds to with foot or fist. He occasionally runs afoul the law due to the machinations of his only friend Jin-tae, a local hood of some sort. By apparent happenstance, he becomes the prime suspect of the murder of a teenage girl. Lacking the competence to defend himself and with complete innocence he allows the police, whose only evidence is a golf ball bearing his name found near the scene, to extract a confession. The mother then takes responsibility for conducting an investigation to uncover the real murderer and vindicating her son.</p>\n\n	<p>With skillful pictorial economy, we immediately learn a great deal about the relationship between mother and son. Hye-ja is introduced (after the dance sequence) slicing some kind of herb with a blade while, at the same time, watching Do-joon through her store window. Motherhood means work; it means sacrifice, but she has always one protective eye cast upon her son. This is also premonition, for just as she watches a car speeds past knocking Do-joon down to the sidewalk. She responds immediately, cutting her finger with the blade in the process, darting out the door to her son, who is apparently unharmed, on the opposite side of the street. She has such a strong connection with her child it verges on the mystical. It&#8217;s the kind of thing that is difficult to capture with prose and Bong Joon-ho makes efficient use of the techniques of cinema to express it visually.</p>\n\n	<p>This scene is repeated, with a variation, a short time later. Dividing her attention between a customer and her son through the glass, she darts outside once again as Do-joon is hustled in to a police car (picked up for the murder). In the first scene it is she who is injured because of her son (slashing her finger during the hit-and-run), but in this scene it is Do-joon who is injured because of her. The driver is distracted by her giving chase on foot and never sees the van crashing in to them, sending the car reeling with Do-joon cuffed in the backseat. So their relationship is reciprocal; one bound inexorably to the other.</p>\n\n	<p>Bong Joon-ho goes to great lengths, including the aforementioned scenes, to express the intimacy, the oneness, of mother and son. The profundity of which may be fathomed in the fact of sleeping together; it is even, and most strongly, to be found emanating from her face. Kim Hye-ja dominates this character, and by extension the entire film, with her face—and especially her eyes—more than anything else. She has a striking beauty for a woman in her fifties and despite the well-worn features that come with motherhood. There&#8217;s also a hilarious scene of her chasing after Do-joon to give him his medicine. He&#8217;s pissing against a wall while waiting for a bus so she takes the opportunity to pour the liquid down his throat as urine issues down the alley.</p>\n\n	<p>It&#8217;s hard to imagine a more striking, and honest, portrayal. A brief perusal of the actresses credits yields a short list—one interestingly filled with mother roles (her characters&#8217; names often just &#8216;mother&#8217; or some variation)–so it may be that she has relatively little training and perhaps this accounts for the seemingly effortless and realistic performance she gives. Whatever the case, Bong extracts a powerful performance from this actress, the kind that could easily mean an Academy Award for someone like, say, Meryl Streep.</p>\n\n	<p>This can&#8217;t be understated. In the Hollywood system, at least since the mid-40s, women have overwhelmingly been accessory, exploited sexually or in other ways; or if they are treated with a measure of respect it&#8217;s often simply because they are cast in a typically masculine (read: heroic) role (think <em>Thelma and Louise</em>). While Bong uses this character metonymically, as a representation of mother&#8217;s everywhere, he never exploits. He treats this character with tenderness, taking great care to encircle her, capturing her emotionally, intellectually and psychologically from every angle. This is an exciting and refreshing development for Western eyes&#8212;even for those of the East, for while Korea is not precisely invested of this legacy, it is no less true for Asian cinema than American.</p>\n\n	<p>While this story begins and ends with one woman, in-between Bong certainly strays (to its benefit) from the heart of the film, at times playing with memory and perception, exploring teenage sexuality and youth politics, Korean class hierarchy, and police abuse/ineptitude once again as he did with <em>Memories of Murder</em>. And all of this is captured in striking and idiosyncratic ways. The kind of frame compositions less interested in symbolism than evocation.</p>\n\n	<p>This director is truly charting his own path through cinematic art. He has so far consistently produced not only great films, but genre-blending, humorous, endearing and beautiful works of art; exploiting genre and character types as needed and employing convention only when inevitable—when it&#8217;s more useful or convenient perhaps than his own conception. At the risk of seeming trite, I name Mr. Bong Joon-ho among the most brilliant of new talent, and at the very least the most important director working in Korea. With the aplomb of a master he reinvented the murder-mystery with <em>Memories of Murder</em>, also reinvented the monster-thriller (crafting an amusing and affecting family portrait) with <em>The Host</em> and with <em>Mother</em> he&#8217;s reinvigorated the mother/son relationship on film, simultaneously giving us one of the most moving and provocative portraits of a woman and a mother yet recorded.</p>\n\n	<p>For his coda the director returns to where we began. Hye-ja is on a bus at sunset and, with the same score from film&#8217;s opening, she follows the lead of the other women dancing up and down the aisle. This is a beautifully, and boldly, shot sequence; one apparently using a telephoto lens at great distance, following the moving vehicle. It is jittery, in-and-out of focus, but spellbinding as if the camera too is enraptured, taken in by the rhythm as the characters are. The opening sequence now seems to say: &#8220;this is a story of a woman,&#8221; while her body condenses and explicates her story through dramatic dance. It also seems to signify a measure of liberation for a woman who has just, at great cost, spared her son an unenviable fate.</p>', 'Mother', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '142-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-08-17 17:01:20', '2014-08-17 17:01:20', '', 142, 'http://localhost/NewGravel/142-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

It furnishes a metaphysical, even a humanist, model—provoking a more profound moral interpretation from a genre subsumed by fantastical violence. The affliction of the lead necessitates violence to be sure but fantasy, for the most part, is flatly discarded. Unconcerned with vampire lore, indicated by form and early on with a somewhat more realistic than usual cause of the disease, <em>Thirst</em> instead beckons our attention upon the politics of sex, violence and virtue.</p>\n\n	<p>Immediately striking, and signaling a departure from convention, is Park&#8217;s opening sequence. Rather than an ordinary establishing shot introducing characters or setting, we get a parable of sorts with strong overtones of foreshadowing—and perhaps a dichotomy as well. There is a very large man in a hospital bed: near death, having slaked his arteries gluttonously for many years. Heavy of breath, he shares a story from his youth in which he overcame his strong <em>hunger</em> so that two starving children might eat. He asks our lead, a priest having entered mid-anecdote, &#8220;Think God will remember that?&#8221; and then he dies shortly after. This implicates the fate of our lead who, though he has yet to be formally introduced, has seen the consequences of succumbing to base desire and will shortly be burdened with his own appetites.</p>\n\n	<p>Thus, <em>Thirst</em> concerns the trials of this man: a priest named Sang-hyun, ably portrayed by rising star and Park regular Kang-ho Song. Sensing that something in his life, his service to the Church, or something in the world around him (poverty, misery) is terribly amiss he decides to volunteer for an experiment to find a cure for a lethal disease known as the Emmanuel Virus—one afflicting only men. Sang-hyun is the only man of 50 to survive a dose of the virus as a result of a tainted blood infusion. After recovering he becomes a sort of demigod, called &#8220;The Bandaged Saint,&#8221;  to the masses of his congregation&#8212;many of whom attempt to follow in his footsteps, boosting the number of dead dramatically. He soon discovers that he now requires human blood to satiate the latent effects of the disease.</p>\n\n	<p>The experiment in the beginning is a brilliantly executed accelerated montage, encapsulating months in less than 8 minutes of screen time. This tactic is employed to great effect elsewhere in the film, such as the rhapsody of blood lust overtaking Sang-hyun for the first time, and in Park&#8217;s other films; something he is fond of and also exceedingly good at.</p>\n\n	<p>Kang-woo is a new member of the congregation and, recognizing him as a schoolfriend, invites Sang-hyun to join his family Mahjong night. His wife, Tae-ju, is oppressed in their home; living as a servile caretaker for Kang-woo, who is enfeebled, and subject to a didactic mother-in-law, her life is misery. She slips out of the house in the middle of the night to run through the city streets—her secret and temporary liberation. She is immediately attracted to Sang-hyun, despite his relationship to the church, and he to her, but she attempts to repress her feelings as Sang-hyun struggles to chasten his new-found powers.</p>\n\n	<p>Once reciprocated, the sexual/violent escapade to follow propels the plot: Sang-hyun attempts a moral life, preferring to steal blood packets from the hospital rather than to kill. Of course the disease allows only a vestige of his former self for even stealing (and in this case from those who desperately need blood) is something he would never do as a priest. This may lessen the internal struggle because the story progresses in such a way that renouncing the church (and his humanity) is inevitable&#8212;the lingering question is not &#8220;if&#8221; but &#8220;when.&#8221; And indeed he does, steadily exploiting his powers, taking another man&#8217;s wife and soon progressing to murder.</p>\n\n	<p><em>Thirst</em> manages to glibly juggle its narrative focus: the supernatural is always in view, but for a film rife with blood and death the most engaging (and memorable) elements remain the troubling domestic life of Tae-ju and her liberating romance with Sang-hyun. On top of these sexual politics, and perhaps fueling them, a theme emerges: humanity is a fragile thing indeed and the good life, even for the pious among us, must be cultivated. Justifying his first despicable act as necessary for survival, Sang-hyun steadily, and easily, drifts toward perdition. The vampire genre, then, is a means for these didacticisms rather than an end-in-itself (as so many other films are).</p>\n\n	<p>For some reason I imagined a vampire tale beneath this director and therefore approached it with trepidation. Vampires are very bankable items in the oughts and it seemed Park Chan-wook might be cashing in as he did with his timely vengeance trilogy (which were, to me, in vogue at the time thanks to films like <em>Kill Bill</em>). I do not intend to disparage his earlier work (or its fans) for those films are certainly worthy of praise. Honestly, I wasn&#8217;t sure what to expect from this director after his epic vengeance trilogy. If nothing else, he <em>has</em> succeeded here in inverting expectation by offering a very refreshing take on the vampire genre, filled with dark, brackish humor of the sort we&#8217;ve come to expect from this filmmaker and which only Park seems capable.</p>', 'Thirst', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '129-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-08-17 17:01:20', '2014-08-17 17:01:20', '', 129, 'http://localhost/NewGravel/129-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Guy Hoffman (Mel Gibson) is a young Aussie journalist arriving in Jakarta on the eve of the &#8217;30 September Movement&#8217; coup attempt. Guy&#8217;s predecessor is so eager to leave Indonesia that he doesn&#8217;t acquaint Guy with his local contacts, but Guy goes nonetheless, like any good film loner, hoping to &#8220;bluff his way through&#8221;. Billy Kwan (Linda Hunt), a half-Chinese, half-pint photographer, takes a keen interest in the neophyte and hopes to acquaint him with the environs and possibly become his new partner. Billy introduces Guy to the sultry Jillian (Sigourney Weaver), an officer at the British Embassy, who quickly promulgates a fling.</p>\n\n	<p>Peter Weir&#8217;s adaptation of C.J. Koch&#8217;s popular novel is a tempest of politics, rebellion and romantic intrigue, where time and space are tantamount considerations in a work that seeks the universe. Weir again utilizes the photographic talents of Russell Boyd whose work is consistently mesmerizing. Though the film was primarily shot in the Philippines, Boyd&#8217;s camera probes the streets and slums, the river lean-tos and graceful estates with awe as if it were Jakarta. Maurice Jarre&#8217;s score is no less enchanting. These combined talents make for a riveting drama and a romantic exodus by our lovers&#8212;Gibson and Weaver have a natural chemistry in this film, and their rebellious romp through dangerous territories lives up to its promise. But the film is every bit as heart-rending as it is romantic. </p>\n\n	<p>Billy Kwan is the film&#8217;s conscience, an altruist who puts himself at risk to help those who can&#8217;t help themselves, and speaks for them likewise. Initially praising Sukarno&#8217;s government, he comes to loathe it for its circumspect rationing and subsequent neglect of the food shortages causing starvation and upheaval. Billy desperately wants to photograph the turmoil, and he needs Guy to provide him a context. We learn that Guy is in Jakarta primarily because of a sensation piece he did on poverty, a report which Jill found &#8220;melodramatic&#8221;. Billy tells Guy a parable penned by Dostoyevsky as a sort of litmus test, for he hopes Guy shares his feelings on social action and is willing to be his counterpart. But we get to know Guy better than that. He probably exaggerated that star-making article&#8212;not because he believed in it, but because it suited his career at the moment.</p>\n\n	<p>At the apex of the love affair, Jillian tells Guy why she&#8217;s leaving the country shortly. She has knowledge of an arms shipment scheduled to arrive in a few days, from the Chinese to the <span class="caps">PKI</span> (the Communist Party of Indonesia), the ostensible perpetrators of the coup (although, in real life, it later came to light that the coup was entirely an internal Army one, intended to preserve Sukarno&#8217;s power). She tells Guy in order to protect him, so that he&#8217;ll leave with her and get out of harm&#8217;s way. Jakarta will not be a friendly place to foreigners once violence erupts. Instead, Guy sees this as the big story he&#8217;s been looking for, and he doesn&#8217;t care if it puts him in danger or compromises Jill&#8217;s status at the Embassy.</p>\n\n	<p>Guy is a likable jerk from start to finish, never maturing or reconciling himself with those he damages, yet his charms make it all too easy to root for him. He puts himself and his driver at unnecessary risk by attempting to approach a military-controlled palace for an interview with one of Sukarno&#8217;s subordinates, which results in the bludgeoning of his left eye. When the coup collapses and Guy partially recovers, he convinces his loyal guide, who is <span class="caps">PKI</span> and thus at risk no matter where he travels, to drive him to the airport to catch the last plane out of Jakarta. While Guy plays the opportunistic observer, Billy is an active manipulator of events; he keeps a myriad of files on the people he cares about in order to be an agent of change while Guy simply records misery and takes a check. Guy and his fellow journalists represent the old imperialists, the exploiters of grief, characteristics Billy comes to associate with Sukarno as well. In a selfless and haphazardous move toward the end of the film, Billy attempts to wave a banner from a hotel room that says &#8220;Sukarno, Feed Your People&#8221; as the president&#8217;s motorcade approaches.</p>\n\n	<p>In a film that is mostly remembered for Linda Hunt&#8217;s incredible turn as the male co-star, for which she won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, there are quite a number of other things that recommend it including, but not limited to, Peter Weir&#8217;s deft editing and his creation of credible atmospherics. He and Boyd successfully convey a nation&#8217;s moment of turmoil and trepidation, a time of danger in a place of contingency.</p>', 'The Year of Living Dangerously', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '99-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-08-17 17:01:20', '2014-08-17 17:01:20', '', 99, 'http://localhost/NewGravel/99-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

He is a terrorist, freedom fighter, idealist, monster, hero, a sham and a fool depending on whom you ask. What <em>Hunger</em> does so well is using this historical consciousness of events to its advantage, deftly handling and, drawing on, long established and firm beliefs. This is a delicate subject—one certain to provoke—and a bold undertaking for first-time director Steve McQueen.</p>\n\n	<p>Perhaps to its detriment <em>Hunger</em> is aimed squarely at a European audience, presuming knowledge of the events depicted. Given this McQueen could have divested his film from its politics (and in a certain way he does) but he doesn&#8217;t <em>quite</em> do this. <em>Hunger</em> elects rather to actively participate in the historical dialectic, but it does so from a distance, presenting both the Irish Republican Army and the British in a rather uncharming light. Of course this works to great effect for the rest of the world, viewers unfamiliar with &#8220;The Troubles&#8221; or the recent history of the <span class="caps">IRA</span> generally. We have no emotional investment in the struggle and therefore must judge what we are shown and not what we are not shown.</p>\n\n	<p><em>Hunger</em> montages the series of &#8220;political status protests&#8221; by <span class="caps">IRA</span> inmates from the mid-70&#8217;s through the early 80&#8217;s, culminating with the mass Irish hunger strike of 1981. Motive, like much else intrinsic to this struggle, is contested but the stated reason for protest is the crown&#8217;s removal of &#8220;Special Category Status&#8221; for inmates and subsequent refusal to acknowledge Republicans as political prisoners as opposed to common criminals. The film opens with the first of these protests—the so-called &#8220;blanket protest&#8221; in which prisoners refused to wear prison garments—and then proceeds to those that followed, establishing first the struggle without specifically commenting upon it (leaving most viewers in the dark) and second the prison system itself. </p>\n\n	<p>Interestingly, our lead is not immediately the focus. For the first half in fact his character is peripheral; just one man among many. This group is at first a collective: we don&#8217;t know their names, or their crimes, and there is no clear indication of which are Republicans. We are forced, in effect, to put identity aside and see them as merely &#8220;prisoners&#8221;. But before we see them even, the camera follows a prison guard inside and outside of the pen. Its a bit heavy-handed, but this is the only way we can possibly empathize with the “British” by suggesting that they have lives without, though they are lives infected with the violence intrinsic to their work. Following this one guard gives us a link to the external world (and its politics) and proves that one can never truly leave; that our actions can&#8217;t be divorced from who we are. However, aside from these brief sequences and an overdubbed British newscast the politics of the external world are dismissed in favor of the politics of prison life; verbal explication in favor of pictorial.</p>\n\n	<p>McQueen gives us, in effect, pure, intense, cinematic-visual experience, paced loosely but evenly. At times the aesthetic value of a particular shot may seem indulgent, even dubious, but collectively they are overwhelmingly effective. The grim atmosphere of prison life is built, as so many bricks, with intimate, vulnerable compositions, delicate camera movements; often in silence or near silence (the score being intermittent, quiet and subtle). McQueen renders his subjects from a distance in key scenes effectively alienating us. We are seemingly held captive between indulging the propaganda and identifying with these men qua human beings. The director creates and amplifies this tension, offsetting the emotionally distant and deferential shots with the very penetrating sequences of cell life.</p>\n\n	<p>The most striking of these must be the film&#8217;s treatment of the &#8220;dirty protest&#8221; where prisoners refused to wash and smeared the walls of their cells with excrement. At least one man does not merely smear, but rather crafts a work of art with his feces. The filmmakers insist on capturing this fetid, geometrically-precise spiral adorning his wall from multiple angles and for quite a long time; it even graces the cover of the <span class="caps">DVD</span> release.</p>\n\n	<p>We never see these men commit acts of violence but only hear the accusations of their captors. Instead we see them repeatedly brutalized in several scenes; one of them preceded by prison guards in riot gear beating their shields thunderously with billy clubs. This forms a strong aural motif, one present from the very beginning, but for the rest of the film associated with this brutality. A man later scrubs urine off the floor (that earlier each prisoner had spilled from their cells in coordination, called &#8220;slopping-out&#8221;) of a long hallway. The camera is fixed at the opposite end so that he steadily approaches the foreground, pounding the squeegee against the stone to the same staccato rhythm.</p>\n\n	<p>Another scene shows a vicious one-sided attack as guards drive a naked man (Bobby in fact) through several rooms to bathe, shear and shave him. Even the grooming is incredibly savage. This violence seems to be more poignant, more agonizing, than a typical action movie (with bullets, blood and gore) and it&#8217;s owed once again to the distance of the camera, and certainly to the dehumanizing effect of stripping the men bare in the first place. This will tend to create sympathy for the <span class="caps">IRA</span> for many viewers, but McQueen&#8217;s film can hardly be construed as an endorsement (for either side). The strength of their perseverance, and of Bobby&#8217;s in particular, cannot be denied, but tenacity is not the equal of righteousness or rectitude.</p>\n\n	<p>If the first half of the film alienates us from these prisoners, the second half humanizes them. In-between we get a nearly twenty minute scene serving as a kind of fulcrum. Most of the film&#8217;s dialogue takes place here, and McQueen uses it to realize the character of Bobby Sands; we learn his hopes, his fears, his ideas on justice, the church. The photographer places the lens at a distance, profiling priest and prisoner, where it remains (without cuts) for about 13 minutes during which time Bobby burns and sucks back three cigarettes (a welcome reprieve from his bible-paper rolled prison smokes). We also hear his plans for the hunger strike allowing the priest to punctuate the moral imperative. He asks Bobby if he&#8217;s resolved to die, if he intends to commit what he calls suicide, to which Bobby responds with a macabre childhood tale illustrating his moral clarity. But in here he is no priest, nor is Bobby a freedom fighter; behind these walls they are only men. The silence of the priest before departure indicates his acknowledgment of, even respect for, the moral force of Bobby&#8217;s conviction.</p>\n\n	<p>This scene will be much talked about, if not for its syntagmatic significance within the film then at the very least for the superb acting of Fassbender and Cunningham. They have a strong script to work with (for this scene is so engaging it may not feel like 20 minutes) but, regardless, it&#8217;s difficult to maintain character (and remember all of those lines!) for such a long time. It&#8217;s also an exercise in mise-en-scène, whereas the rest of the film is largely montage; the director carefully keeping us distant (and therefore unable to discern the actors&#8217; features) while the two shoot the bull, and then cutting to mid-shot to reveal their faces when they cut the crap and get to the issue at hand.</p>\n\n	<p>What follows is the hunger strike itself: a long montage of Bobby withering to nothing, refusing food, languishing in sick bed, ointment being applied to lesions. It is painful to watch, but it&#8217;s also probably the least interesting part of the film. And it&#8217;s hard to tell if these sequences were shot in such a way to give the appearance of starvation or if the actor did indeed subject himself to extreme weight loss. Either way, <em>Hunger</em> resolves itself by fulfilling its desirous title. Bobby is the first of several men to starve before the strike is called off, and history has recorded the rest.</p>', 'Hunger', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '127-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-08-17 17:01:21', '2014-08-17 17:01:21', '', 127, 'http://localhost/NewGravel/127-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

From its pages he gleans not only something about his family&#8217;s past, but some preconscious part of himself. What unfolds is a fable of personal and cultural demons, given record in the Iikura chronicle and exorcised throughout the generations.</p>\n\n	<p>	The chronicle of the Iikura clan first takes us to Jirozaemon Hidekiyo who commits seppuku after a military blunder to save face for his Lord. His son, Sijaemon, is ensured a handsome stipend that he soon squanders due to the inept servitude to <em>his</em> Lord. Sijaemon in turn commits seppuku, and splendidly, allowing the family line to continue&#8230; The chronicles gradually become more detailed and, as the narrator tells us, &#8220;bizarre&#8221;. Iikura Kyutaro is a samurai-in-training who proves himself an adept swordsman. His Lord fawns over him and promotes him to page, which means intimate services in the Lord&#8217;s bed chamber, a proposition Kyutaro initially resists, but eventually submits to for he doesn&#8217;t really have a choice in the matter anyway. Kyutaro falls in love with the wife of his increasingly cruel and jealous Lord, consummates that love, and is summarily castrated as punishment, but not before his progeny finds its womb. The Iikura clan continues&#8230; and so continues the cycle of the cruel Lord exploiting his dutiful retainers.</p>\n\n	<p>	The longest and most interesting segment is also the most brutal and emotionally charged, and it begins with a volcanic eruption. The eruption of Mount Asuma signals the beginning of the Tanmei period, marked by a pronounced famine which lasts nearly a decade. Iikura Shuzo, another adept swordsman, is promoted by Lord Tanuma and with a promotion comes greater and often undesirable duties: Shuzo and other retainers are required to put some poor farmers to the saw, an ugly, draconian execution, prompted by the collective farmers&#8217; direct petition to the government. Not wholly satisfied with Shuzo&#8217;s sacrifices, Lord Tanuma demands Shuzo make a gift of his daughter Sato, dressed up and delivered to Tanuma like a Kyoto doll, even though she has a prior engagement to the young, noble Kazuma. Shuzo reassures his children that all will be well, that &#8220;the lives of samurai do not belong to the samurai.&#8221; Still not contented, Tanuma demands Shuzo&#8217;s wife Maki, who opts to commit ritual seppuku rather than adultery. </p>\n\n	<p>Finally at his wit&#8217;s end, a blindfolded Shuzo is forced to unknowingly execute both his daughter and her fiancee with the &#8216;Sword of Darkness&#8217;, a blindfolded demonstration of skill invented by Shuzo and what first impressed Tanuma enough to promote him. Shuzo is shocked when he discovers his unintentional deed, but he nonetheless persists in his delusion: &#8220;To die in service to your Lord; that is the beginning of loyalty.&#8221; With these words Shuzo too commits seppuku. Tanuma laughs. This episode in particular seems to have a lot of echoes in the work of Masaki Kobayashi, especially <em>Samurai Rebellion</em>. Both feature characters pushed to the brink by their wanton masters and broach themes of loyalty, sovereignty and justice in feudal Japan.</p>\n\n	<p>Kinnosuke Nakamura plays all six of Susumu&#8217;s ancestors very competently, but his portrayal of Shuzo is simply a tour-de-force. Some of the compositions developed by Imai and Makoto Tsuboi, his cinematographer, are startlingly powerful, the camera always seems to know right where Nakamura&#8217;s face will be at its most expressive. Amazing stuff. Unfortunately, the rest of the film isn&#8217;t nearly as good as the Shuzo chapter. We are left with a film that is derelict in its total composition; what could have been a strong series of chapters threaded politically and ideologically with a synergetic impact is more like a sine wave that crests only in the middle. Fortunately, that crest <em>is</em> so strong, but it casts a shadow. It is a thematic microcosm for the entire film, rendering the other chapters redundant, and indulgent. Maybe Imai should have considered a series of films set in chronological motion that explore everything that&#8217;s present here, but in less haste. </p>\n\n	<p>Interestingly, the narrative comes back to Susumu and his fiancée <em>before</em> the prologue chapter. We are given exposition on their personal backgrounds and their relationship, and Imai makes the case that the behavioral predilections on display throughout the centuries in samurai culture have found a new home in the bureaucracy of the modern corporation. Susumu the salary-man and his fiancée work for opposing companies, and the loyalty of each to their respective company tests and almost breaks the confidence they have in each other. But Imai ends on a jarringly optimistic note: the girl awakens from her coma and the couple make amends and look to the future. Perhaps the director or Toei or their screenwriters sensed that the budding youth culture of the &#8217;60s would challenge the collective repose of social-hierarchical conceit and its accompanying narcissism and emerge, if not as staunch anarchists, then as individuals with personal bonds superseding national ones.</p>\n\n	<p>	<em>Bushidô zankoku monogatari</em> is straight-forward, no-nonsense, literary storytelling, to its detriment. We have chapters that are meant to parallel and reinforce one another, but not to stratify or obfuscate our thematic understanding. So there is plenty of redundancy here, but perhaps that subtly illustrates the point: Japan as victim of its own inability to learn, to grow. Its embrace of a ruthless patriarchy goes back centuries, as the film stresses pointedly, despite the kind of superficial changes that people often call progress.</p>', 'Cruel Tales of Bushido', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '125-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-08-17 17:01:21', '2014-08-17 17:01:21', '', 125, 'http://localhost/NewGravel/125-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Admittedly it seems somewhat more difficult to define than other genres like the Western or Horror, but the attempt is often co-opted by a tendency to dismiss as exploitation or worse. This is unfortunate, for some of the most interesting films in recent years (for instance Refn&#8217;s <em>Bronson</em> or McQueen&#8217;s <em>Hunger</em>) could be classified as prison-films, however we define them, and I see immense possibilities yet to be realized within this seemingly narrow category. At first glance it seems to be largely defined by its setting, but many prison films are set only partially behind concrete walls. Jim Jarmusch’s <em>Down By Law</em>, for example, has the concrete lockup as its central motif, yet only 30 of its 102 minutes are set there.</p>\n\n	<p>If we are to hazard a definition of the category a working one might be: “a film taking place in and dominated physically by a prison, in whole or in part, and often characterized by alienation, dehumanization and despair.” A number of films set in prison do not neatly fit this definition, but nevertheless the setting seems to necessitate confronting these issues in some way. The idea of prison can be used synecdochically as metaphor (for society as a whole) though more often the setting is exploited for its metaphysical potential. What better way to approach a dialectic of freedom than to deprive the primary subject of it?</p>\n\n	<p>At the very least we can see, and try to understand, how the other half lives. Most settings are somewhat identifiable and familiar in the general, but few of us know what’s its like to live in a 8’ by 12’ cell.

Aside from a brief parole in 1982, during which he had a stint as a bare-knuckle fighter and took the better-fitting moniker &#8216;Charles Bronson&#8217;, he has been locked-up every day of his life to the present. Primarily known to the British public as a taker of hostages and &#8220;Britain&#8217;s Most Expensive/Violent Prisoner&#8221;, Bronson is both a subject of fascination and target of derision. Ostensibly directing a biopic, Nicolas Winding Refn has taken far more liberties with the man&#8217;s story than is ordinarily acceptable given that kind of genre limitation.</p>\n\n	<p>From the get-go, Refn challenges audience expectations. The opening sequence is genius, and perhaps the kind of amalgam of image and sound that couldn&#8217;t be more perfect for rendering the ugly, caged intensity of the male id. We know just how brutal a man like Bronson can be from the moment we see him performing his floor exercises&#8212;naked except for the grease or excrement that covers his muscled body and the intense red light that bathes every millimeter of the frame&#8212;later to be rudely interrupted by baton-wielding guards; over this balletic chaos Scott Walker&#8217;s appropriately forlorn composition &#8220;The Electrician&#8221; plays right up until the film&#8217;s title appears under a now fully-clothed Bronson staring evilly at the camera.</p>\n\n	<p>Addressing the camera Bronson tells us of his childhood and history to the present, but against expectations it is a very normal one (not too normal, he tells us; he experiences his fair share of violence and victimization). One can&#8217;t help but think at this point, &#8220;are they really going to attempt such an easy explanation of Bronson&#8217;s state of mind?,&#8221; but Refn does no such thing. When Bronson is finally locked up for the first time, he pretends to sob away from the camera before emerging with a terrible laugh, suddenly transported fully-costumed to a vaudeville stage in front of a fully aroused audience.</p>\n\n	<p>Refn makes some clever meta-reference to the first ten minutes of exposition when Bronson tells his theatre audience that he doesn&#8217;t think of prison as &#8220;not bad&#8221;, as &#8220;that would be misrepresenting myself, and I think enough of that has been done already, don&#8217;t you?&#8221; Bronson goes on to tell us about the guards he&#8217;s grappled, the various conditions in the lock-up, amusingly describes the accommodations in all the prisons he&#8217;s been passed around to as if they&#8217;re hotels, and goes on to clarify his position:</p>\n\n	<blockquote>\n		<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t get me wrong. For most people prison is tough, a monotonous nightmare; twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year of pure, unadulterated, living, breathing hell. But for me, prison was finally a place where I could sharpen my tools, hone my skills. It&#8217;s like a battleground, isn&#8217;t it? It was an opportunity. And a place where, soon, every native was going to know my name.&#8221;</p>\n	</blockquote>\n\n	<p>At this point it is made clear that what we are dealing with in this man is not a criminal, he only stole after all a few pounds, but a man who desperately <em>wants</em> to be in prison, and famous. He certainly commits a criminal act, but it isn&#8217;t clear if he even had live rounds in his gun&#8212;a shotgun we see him saw down to the length of a man&#8217;s forearm and then play with like a steel penis&#8212;and he only takes enough to justify wielding the weapon in the first place, perhaps assuming that armed robbery is a better charge than brandishing a weapon for no good reason for which he might just get a slap on the wrist, or be sent to the looney bin.</p>\n\n	<p>Bronson&#8217;s obvious machismo combined with the gunplay implies a latent sexuality, but Refn spends the remainder of the film sculpting a character who couldn&#8217;t be more asexual, at times resembling an impotent steroid abuser or a listless <em>and</em> impotent heroin fiend. It&#8217;s simply the first of many red herrings in a film that many will observe resembles Kubrick&#8217;s <em>A Clockwork Orange</em> a little more than superficially. It&#8217;s true we see Bronson engage in a few sexual liaisons and he even attempts a marriage proposal, but as the character repeatedly reminds everyone around him, he doesn&#8217;t know what it is that he wants. He certainly doesn&#8217;t have any ordinary notions of freedom. The loose redhead he wants to marry tells him he has no ambition, and to prove her wrong he steals an engagement ring.</p>\n\n	<p>The film suffers greatly on repeat viewings from a confusion of both tense and perspective. In attempting to defy expectations and comfortable behavioral explanations, Refn constantly changes pace; there is no dramatic denouement and Bronson&#8217;s confessional narration that dominates the first half of the film is abandoned or forgotten about for much of the rest. What&#8217;s left is a series of sometimes brilliant and occasionally surreal setpieces that raise more questions about the screenplay than they do the characters. Refn and his screenwriter clearly have some ideological notions in mind, but they are left underdeveloped and totally waylaid by Tom Hardy&#8217;s intense performance.</p>\n\n	<p>If I tried I couldn&#8217;t laud Tom Hardy enough, truly one of the most astonishing menaces to ever grace the screen; his entire body owns this character, even as we see Hardy at different stages of his actual training regimen due to a non-chronological shooting schedule. And when the script relegates his body to stasis, Hardy uses his eyes and his mouth to insinuate vast reservoirs of angst underneath. He has a way of breathing only through his nose&#8212;the sound of it is miked very clearly&#8212;which gives a sense of an ego that can&#8217;t be contained even by the limits of Bronson&#8217;s musculature, and ready to burst. Just incredible. And to the surprise of many Hardy&#8217;s is also a remarkably absurd and funny performance, making the character all the more enigmatic.</p>\n\n	<p>In the end Bronson basically becomes, in the words of the effeminate convict who takes him under his artistic wing, a &#8220;budding Magritte&#8221;. Refn wants us to believe some kind of transformation has taken place, but when and where I couldn&#8217;t reckon; the very mustache on Bronson&#8217;s face is the work of an aesthete, not to mention his physique. Nonetheless, the weird marriage of multimedia art and physical violence that takes place during the film&#8217;s climax is intriguing and prefaced by Bronson&#8217;s demand, the only time we witness him make one, for music.</p>', 'Bronson', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '124-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-08-17 17:01:21', '2014-08-17 17:01:21', '', 124, 'http://localhost/NewGravel/124-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
(494, 1, '2014-08-17 17:01:22', '2014-08-17 17:01:22', '	<p><em>Beast Stable</em> may not be the most popular of the original Sasori trilogy, but it is probably the most accomplished in terms of storytelling, both visual and aural. This was to be director Shunya Ito&#8217;s final Scorpion film, again starring Meiko Kaji, who also sings the primary theme (Urumi Bushi), and a few characters from the previous installments. Ito (and the art direction of Tadayuki Kuwana) is less bold here than in <em>Jailhouse: 41</em>, with fewer camera sweeps and manual zooms, but it actually works in this film&#8217;s favor. Gone are the excessive lingering close-ups and the wild metaphors that made <em>Jailhouse: 41</em> so interesting yet so often tedious. Ito has shorn away the excesses while still conceiving of brilliant, eye-popping images and compositions; here the images are more effective because the editing is so much sharper, the pace striking the proper balance between the freneticism of <em>Prisoner #701</em> and the sober deliberateness of <em>Jailhouse</em>.</p>\n\n	<p>Having disposed of the one-eyed warden at the end of <em>Jailhouse</em>, Nami Matsushima is now trying to stay off the radar, but as the opening montage shows us, her face is being broadcast all over Japan. She manages to evade a couple of under-covers on a subway car by mutilating one and during the opening credits we see her dancing through the city with his severed arm manacled to her wrist. She finds a cemetery and successfully looses her cuffs on a tombstone, but collapses from exhaustion. She&#8217;s taken in by Yuki (played superbly by Yayoi Watanabe), who prostitutes herself to take care of her brother, rendered infantile because of some long-suffered cerebral trauma. Matsu is of course attacked by him at the first opportunity, and only Yuki&#8217;s abrupt intervention prevents Matsu from cutting him to pieces. When Yuki admits that she not only nurses her brother, but provides him with sexual release, Matsu reacts with a mixture of sympathy and disgust.</p>\n\n	<p>	Like all Scorpion films character is subordinated to aesthetics, narrative to formal associations. Matsu&#8217;s rational and emotional complexity is always under the surface, and not merely through any deliberateness of character, but it&#8217;s also obscured by her apparently superhuman perception, which Meiko signifies with her large, round, cold eyes. Her silent exterior affords us an opportunity to observe her mental processes through other characters, none of whom is able to contain their internal content like Matsu. She embodies an ideal of womanhood in Ito&#8217;s films, one of both relentless stoicism and providential wrath; ironically the women she pities possess the kind of emotional sensitivity and pliability that she yearns for and of which she is no longer capable. Like a Christ figure, Matsu is forced to maintain both an emotional distance and a moral clarity to do what has to be done, placing herself in the position of fulcrum between good and evil forces.</p>\n\n	<p>	While feeling sympathy for the invariably pathetic women she encounters, there is also present a resoluteness to leave them to a fate she feels is precipitated by a sadistic conspiracy of phalluses, but masochistically yielded to by woman. Matsu yields only strategically and her seemingly infinite patience allows her to win her battles down the road. Ito associates Matsu figuratively with the scorpion, an inscrutable creature of cunning and elegant lethality. When she learns of Yuki&#8217;s pregnancy, Matsu briefly considers killing Yuki&#8217;s brother out of mercy for them both, but it&#8217;s the forced abortion of another abused girl that convinces her otherwise. As in <em>Jailhouse</em>, abortion is both a subject of narrative consequence and subtextual, reinforcing the point that pitiless males have total control over the female body, and in both films Matsu unleashes vengeance upon a state that both fosters and enforces such practices.</p>\n\n	<p>	Matsu&#8217;s revenge on the brothel of the title and its mistress is photographed and edited together by Ito masterfully: we see one of her victims in a car emerging from a car-wash with a blade stuck in his heart, another hanged by his tie from a sleek office building&#8212;and they all exhibit the Scorpion&#8217;s marks; with montage there&#8217;s no need for us to see how it all unfolded. In another scene, Ito recreates the inebriated sense of time of a swank nightclub through clipping, or deleting strands of film stock to accelerate time and expand space; and the artificial lighting and colorful sets perfectly assist the nighttime milieu. Ito also better translates narrative ideas into cinematic ones in this film. When Yuki drops burning matchsticks through manholes and into the sewer to locate the fugitive Matsu, the director shoots them descending from every conceivable angle. Then with a smaller wide-angle lens he blurs their descent until a virtual firestorm of falling matchsticks consumes the toxic tunnels that Matsu darts through. It&#8217;s all of these little details of technique (you&#8217;ll wonder repeatedly how this effect or that effect was achieved) that further enrich the viewing experience, even if they don&#8217;t always inform.</p>\n\n	<p>If you&#8217;ve seen the first two of the trilogy, the fact that Matsu runs into and settles a score with an old prison nemesis won&#8217;t come as a shock, and neither will Ito&#8217;s treatment of the incredible ending. If you have the opportunity to see the trilogy in its entirety, you&#8217;ll understand Ito&#8217;s singular genius. The amount of variation in sets, characters, action, lighting, photography and ambience over the course of these three films is astounding; each has its own peculiar vibe and unique strengths. Overall, this is my personal favorite of the Sasori trilogy and a fine edition to any collection, exploitation or not.</p>', 'Female Prisoner Scorpion: Beast Stable', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '121-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-08-17 17:01:22', '2014-08-17 17:01:22', '', 121, 'http://localhost/NewGravel/121-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
(495, 1, '2014-08-17 17:01:22', '2014-08-17 17:01:22', '	<p>A documentary-filmmaking crew is dispatched to Culloden Moor to provide coverage on what may be a historically important battle between a Jacobite confederacy of Highland Scots and an English army loyal to the British government&#8230; except that it&#8217;s already taken place. The year is 1746 and we already know the battle has at least some historical import if someone bothered to record it. Anachronism is part of director Watkins&#8217; conceptual tool belt, and he employs it here with no less imagination and ingenuity than later masterpieces. If it sounds like a mockumentary, and technically it is, keep in mind that the upending of genre conventions is only a mere pretense, a vehicle to take us somewhere else entirely. Out of time.</p>\n\n	<p>Another Watkins trademark is usefully employed in <em>Culloden</em>: his utilizing the talents of non-professional actors. We get to know a whole host of characters in uniform, each with distinct features and predilections, each with a reason for fighting no matter how delusional. The Scots by and large are a rabble of men, cobbled together from various clans for various reasons, foremost among them money for their families and glory for their names. Watkins treats us to full-frame close-ups with laconic sketches drawn from the characters&#8217; own lips, giving the audience a sense of personal investment in the battle to come and raising our ire at the whole bloody mess.</p>\n\n	<p>Perhaps the figure that looms largest is Charles Edward Stuart, commander-in-chief of the confederacy of Scots and pretender to the English throne, who is remembered by history and in song as Bonnie Prince Charlie, the dashing, young rebel and reluctant war-maker. Watkins dissipates this inflated image immediately. He presents Charles as a bumbling half-wit utterly convinced of his own rectitude and invulnerability (though in terms of historical inscrutability he was right). He puts his faith in Captain Sir John McDonald as battle-strategist, perhaps the greatest ineptitude of all. Culloden Moor is the wrong place at the wrong time to stage a last-ditch offensive, and everyone behind Scottish lines seems to know it except Charles and his cronies.</p>\n\n	<p>The first half of the film up to and including the waging of the battle is marked stylistically by an incongruity between narration and visual content. The narrator (Watkins himself) gives us a colored account of the men in uniform and their present circumstances&#8212;he mentions that Captain McDonald is &#8220;aged, frequently intoxicated and&#8230; a man of the most limited capacities&#8221;; and Charles Edward&#8217;s only prior military experience was &#8220;ten days attendance at a siege at the age of thirteen&#8221;&#8212;as the camera captures them in heroic poses. In fact, if you muted the volume, the entire first half might appear to be nothing more than a spontaneous document. </p>\n\n	<p>What proceeds is one of the most lopsided battles in recorded history, with the Scots being painted all over the lowland peat by bullet and cannon. Reporting from the sidelines is famous historian Andrew Henderson, who amusingly updates the documentary crew on the shifting tides of the battle and often has to shout to be heard over the din. Even Henderson cannot make what&#8217;s on display more compelling than a man swatting a fly. The English rank and file appear at times to cringe in the direction of the Scots. This is a victory tainted by feelings of pity for the enemy&#8212;a queasy satisfaction. During and after the battle the director continually tests our perspective. Instead of presenting events as they were recorded&#8212;case closed&#8212;he allows the audience to contemplate what could have been. What if the leadership were different? What if Prince Charles had contemplated the protestations of his own men? What if clan loyalties hadn&#8217;t interfered with conduct? What if Culloden Moor hadn&#8217;t been deemed a suitable battleground? </p>\n\n	<p>But of even greater interest perhaps than the battle itself is the ethnic cleansing that followed, and this is where Watkins&#8217; dramatic emphasis is really placed. There is a desire on the English side not to merely punish or demand tribute from the clans, but to extirpate the families who raised and supported the soldiers. What follows is a brutal campaign, one that effectively &#8220;[tears] apart forever the clan system of the Scottish Highlands&#8221;. Watkins again punctuates the brutality with an ironic disparity between temporal and spatial representation, but this time the narrator gives us the widely-dispersed and believed account while the camera shows us otherwise. Meanwhile, Charles, who abandoned his men on the battlefield, has taken shelter among his supporters until the opportunity arises to flee to France. Thus the memory of Charles the war hero survives the merciless aftermath of his blundering. To the victor belong the spoils, which includes the account.</p>\n\n	<p>Watkins uses history to posit his own immaterial dialectics, asking us to think of events in abstract and often complex ways, as the alternating modes of presentation and perspective would suggest: in the film&#8217;s second act, the illusion of vérité is largely kept intact, but the camera favors a more dramatically selective approach&#8212;and the tonal shift amply demonstrates, better than any revisionist historian could, the tragedy not only of the inhuman acts committed, but of the gloss of comforting myth over reality. Those folks who are fed up with the way history is presented by the well-meaning pedagogues, the apologists and the reigning arbiters of realpolitik, would do well to seek out Peter Watkins&#8217; oeuvre. He understands that the presentation of history has less to do with facts than with hypotheses. As this film and others will attest, this is a filmmaker who would rather defy stubborn beliefs than deify them.</p>', 'Culloden', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '98-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-08-17 17:01:22', '2014-08-17 17:01:22', '', 98, 'http://localhost/NewGravel/98-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
(496, 1, '2014-08-17 17:01:22', '2014-08-17 17:01:22', '	<p><em>Kramer vs. Kramer</em> is essentially a character-driven drama. While there is little to be said for its technical direction, though to be sure it is ably directed and written for the screen by Robert Benton, this picture&#8217; strength lies in its performances, furnished intelligently by both Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep.</p>\n\n	<p>Ted Kramer’ (Hoffman) obsession with his career as an advertising executive and resultant indifference to his wife Joanna (Streep) has driven her away. Kramer is left to raise their son of five years on his own. At first the two have an antagonistic relationship as Billy struggles to adapt to life without his loving mother and Ted is forced to sacrifice the work he loves to care for the boy. Kramer befriends his neighbor Margaret, also a single parent and the woman who advised Joanna to leave. She witnesses firsthand the transformation of Ted and Billy, who grow to have a tender relationship. A year and a half after abandoning her family Joanna returns to New York to reclaim her son. The struggle for custody ensues.</p>\n\n	<p>On the surface <em>Kramer vs. Kramer</em>, as the title implies, is a dramatization of a narrative we are all too familiar with in America; namely the tragic compromises that follow from divorce, particularly when a young child enters the calculus of what is ultimately a vicious legal battle. But more than that, at bottom, this film is about a man learning to be a father; to meet his encumbered obligation and live for something outside of himself. This allows Benton some license for humor: an early scene of Kramer attempting to cook breakfast for the boy resulting in a disaster of French toast stands out. It also allows Hoffman to express himself in some of the films more affecting scenes: reading to the boy before bed, dashing through the streets of Manhattan clenching him in his arms after a playground incident followed by a beautifully shot sequence of Kramer supporting his head and whispering to him while a doctor sutures the gash above his eye.</p>\n\n	<p>The truly transforming event for Kramer is the legal battle itself. He loses his job because of it and, to evince his competence as a parent before the court, is forced to find another job immediately. He tells his lawyer to give him 24 hours in which time he practically demands a job at another firm which pays less and for which he is overqualified. The trial montage itself is theater for some of the more arresting exchanges in the film but is also, unfortunately, unrealistically intense. The lawyers continually berate both of our titular characters, something that would never happen in reality, eliciting tears from Joanna when confronted with the accusation of failing at her every relationship. This may, however, be a necessary sin for a climactic reason as well as a thematic one and, regardless, the approach at least feels authentic. In these scenes the Kramers confront their demons and begin to question for the first time whether either one of them is fit to parent. They also realize they have both selfishly and childishly hurt the other for the sake of custody.</p>\n\n	<p>One incisive narrative feature gleaned from the courtroom is Benton&#8217;s strong statement regarding the legal precedence of awarding custody to the mother by default, a form of judicial discrimination that began to change by the release of this film and which is practically non-existent today. Without condemnation the director grants equal weight and consideration for both Ted and Joanna&#8217; views, while at the same time emphasizing the uphill battle for the father despite having cared for the boy for almost two years because the mother abdicated her responsibility. Ted, of course, bears some culpability for her departure as well as a moral burden for his prior neglect of his family.</p>\n\n	<p>This film&#8217;s major weakness, at least narratively, is the denouement. Instead of taking the obvious route of the boy going to live with Joanna, perhaps accompanied by a heartbreaking farewell between Ted and Billy, Benton decides to append a clichéd, feel-good ending. Ostensibly, Joanna&#8217; guilt leads her to reject custody and allow Billy to stay with his father. You can kind of sense this happening before actually seeing it on screen, but still you might be thinking, &#8220;no, it&#8217;s too obvious.. this film won&#8217;t succumb to that kind of &#8230;&#8221; and then it happens. If you&#8217;ve identified more with the father it&#8217;s almost vindicating, but still it leaves a bad aftertaste. Aside from that minor infraction, however, the film accomplishes the modest goals it sets for itself and, despite being grossly overestimated by the Academy (winning Best Picture that year over <em>Apocalypse Now</em>), is ultimately an entertaining and endearing picture.</p>', 'Kramer vs. Kramer', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '123-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-08-17 17:01:22', '2014-08-17 17:01:22', '', 123, 'http://localhost/NewGravel/123-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
